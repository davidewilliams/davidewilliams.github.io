      <description>Dear, Dillan, Ashley, Dwyane &amp;amp; Daniel,
How are all of you doing this week? I hope
you have been okay. I often wonder if
you are happy or not. I have suffered
from depression my entire life and still do.
I fear I may have passed this on to you through
my actions, poor choices, and of course genetics.
I always tell myself if I get to hold you one</description>

I love you guys and I try to write you so you know that
I am always thanking [sic] of you and that I care.

shape to play ball or ride a bike with you in the years to come.

      <description>Dear Children,
I know it has been a couple of weeks since I have written
you guys an actual letter. I have been trying to
contact my lawyer to see if the address I have been
writing to you at is current. I love you, I wish
I knew weather or not you have been getting my letters,
I&amp;#8217;m going to continue to write &amp;amp; just hope for the best.</description>

      <description>Troy challenged us to be a witness last week so I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about what being a witness means. A witness is someone who has knowledge of an event from personal observation or experience who gives testimony, either oral or written, about what they claim to know.
I love the Bible. I love history. I love Biblical history. I&amp;#8217;m going to expand on and back fill a single verse found in three of the gospels about some witnesses to the Crucifixion of Christ.</description>

      <description>Dear kids,
When I wrote this it was two days before Thanksgiving, they are
giving us chicken breasts, mash potatoes &amp;amp; stuffing. A pretty good
meal considering. I miss you all so much, I know
it seems like forever but this will eventually only be a brief
moment in time. I will wait patiently for as long as it
takes in order to hold you in my arms again. I love you</description>

      <description>Dear Children,
I love you guys so much I think of you everyday &amp;amp; night.
Are you guys going to be doing any Christmas carroling this
year? I know people would love to get visits from angels like
all of you. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you guys ever pay visits to any nursing
homes or elderly people, but they love the company. I talk to your
grandpa, my father, about twice a week, he is living in Florida</description>

      <description>My name is David Williams. I&amp;#8217;m leaning toward Plan 1 and here’s why.
I have four children at Springville. They&amp;#8217;re getting a quality education. They have teachers that know and care about them, and the kids know and care about the teachers too. I’m concerned that will change.
My daughter is a cheerleader. I’m concerned consolidation will hurt her chances of making the squad.
My boys want to play basketball. There are only x number of spots on a team.</description>

      <description>A girl bought an iPad. When her father saw it, He asked her &amp;#8220;What was the 1st thing you did when you bought it?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;I put an anti-scratch sticker on the screen and bought a cover for the iPad&amp;#8221; she replied.
&amp;#8220;Did someone force you to do so?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t you think it&amp;#8217;s an insult to the manufacturer?&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;No dad! In fact they even recommend using a cover for the iPad.</description>

      <description>Dear Childrens, [sic]
Hey cutie pies how are you all doing, hopefully good. I know
you must be excited about Holloween [sic] this week, remember to be safe &amp;amp; have fun.
Don&amp;#8217;t eat too much candy &amp;amp; make sure to brush your teeth, too much sugar
is bad for your teeth. They got us the new Lion King movie
yesterday. I haven&amp;#8217;t watched it yet but I plan on it today.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been good, have you seen any of the new Disney

      <description>1-14-19 Dear Diary,
I got to go home with Bruce Williams. His mom and dad were so excited to see me again and I was excited to see Dillan, Ashley, and Dwyane again. Even the dogs remembered me! It is a little sad that tonight might be the last time at Bruce&amp;#8217;s house.
One of the first things Bruce and I did was go sledding down the hill. Then we ate dinner and I sat at the table next to Bruce and his mom.</description>

      <description>Dear, David and Lisa.
This is Daniel.
This letter is long overdue, and the truth is I have been a little scared to write it.
There are so many things to say and ask, but I guess the best way is to take it one step at a time and start at the Beginning.
Thank you so much for everything you do, you have been a mericle for me and the children.</description>

      <description>Hi Rebecca,
We received your letter of July 16.
We rented a PO Box from the United States Postal Service expressly for correspondence with Daniel and Nicolle. Clay Cummings, Daniel&amp;#8217;s lawyer at the time, alerted us to an issue. It appeared mail sent to it was either returned or lost. We have no idea what was sent or what we missed. We were unable to convince the USPS of the problem.</description>

      <description>Dear David and Lesa Williams,
July 16, 2018
I am the mother of Daniel Moffett. I received a letter from you a while ago and tried to respond a few
times since. Both letters I mailed to the P.O. Box address given to me in your letter. Both were returned
to me as undeliverable. I verified the address and tried again only to have that one returned as well. So</description>

      <description>Hi Daniel and Nicolle,
We had a good year. We took a vacation to Kentucky, went on a paddleboat ride on the Ohio and went to the Newport Aquarium. We went to the Children&amp;#8217;s Museum. Monster Jam in February was huge. We&amp;#8217;ve been to basketball, soccer, and baseball games. We&amp;#8217;ve been boating on Monroe Reservoir, ice skating, roller skating, several festivals including IU&amp;#8217;s STEM festival, bowling, to movies and a drive-in theatre.</description>

      <description>Thursday, January 11, 2018 {.text-right} Dear Diary,
I got to go home with Dwyane tonight. I was so excited to see my old friends Dillan and Ashley and their brother Bruce! They’ve all gotten so big since the last time I saw them!
And now they’re a real family because Dwyane’s mom and dad, Lesa and Dave, adopted all four of them last summer. Dwyane was telling me all about it.</description>

The lambs have laid down with the sheep.
You are cozy and warm in your bed, my dear.
Please go the fuck to sleep.
The windows are dark in the town, child.
The whales huddle down in the deep.
I&amp;#8217;ll read you one very last book if you swear
You&amp;#8217;ll go the fuck to sleep.
The eagles who soar through the sky are at rest</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s raining, it&amp;#8217;s pouring,
the old man is snoring.
He bumped his head
when he went to bed
and couldn&amp;#8217;t get up in the morning.
It&amp;#8217;s cloudy, it&amp;#8217;s breezy,
the old man is sneezy.
He blew so hard
that he moved the stars,
but of course that wasn&amp;#8217;t easy!
It&amp;#8217;s snowing, it&amp;#8217;s blowing,
the old man is growing.
He ate so much
one day for lunch
every part of him is showing.</description>

News &amp; Media  We are Dave and Lesa Williams. We worked with youth as Sunday School teachers but have no biological children. We attended an Open Arms presentation at church and a few years later we were licensed. We both work full time, thought school age a good fit, so we requested one child five or older. Awaiting our first placement, we respited a sibling group of four: Dillan 4, Ashley 3, Dwyane 19m, and Bruce 7m.</description>

      <description>Hi. This is my first time writing something like this and I hope I do a good job describing the kids for you. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a clue what to write so Lesa and I jotted down things that came to mind. Then we listed some activities they&amp;#8217;ve done as individuals and with us as a family. Then I tried to organize those in a meaningful way and tried to fill in blanks and add details.</description>

Dear David and Lesa Williams,
I was touched to receive your letter last night. First, I would like to personally thank you both for taking
in and caring for Daniel&amp;#8217;s babies. As a single mother, I know how difficult and yet how rewarding raising
children can be. I felt extreme guilt for not being able to take them in myself, but my prayers were
answered, when a lovely couple, such as yourselves, were willing to keep the kids together.</description>

      <description>I saw the following quote and it made me think of the kids, and of their birth parents and grandparents, and I wanted to remember all of their losses.
&amp;#8220;To say goodbye is to die a little.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Raymond Chandler
Hopefully I won&amp;#8217;t take this gift from God for granted, and I won&amp;#8217;t forget the costly price they paid.</description>

      <description>Dear Diary,
Tonight I stayed with my new friend Ashley Moffett. I remember her from last year when I stayed with her older brother Dillan. I was very happy to see my old friend again and to make another new friend! God has blessed me so much! I met some of Ashley&amp;#8217;s friends while we waited for her daddy to pick us up. He bought 113 liters of gas for his truck and then we went to Ashley&amp;#8217;s house!</description>

Wayback Machine Ms. Crystal Meth If my &amp;#8216;glamorous&amp;#8217; lifestyle
Is appealing to you&amp;#8230;
