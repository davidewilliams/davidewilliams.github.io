<p>Hi Daniel and Nicolle,</p>

<p>We had a good year. We took a vacation to Kentucky, went on a paddleboat ride on the Ohio and went to the Newport Aquarium. We went to the Children&#8217;s Museum. Monster Jam in February was huge. We&#8217;ve been to basketball, soccer, and baseball games. We&#8217;ve been boating on Monroe Reservoir, ice skating, roller skating, several festivals including IU&#8217;s STEM festival, bowling, to movies and a drive-in theatre. We&#8217;ve taken many day trips and gone to many events. We&#8217;ve been camping, fishing, and hiking.</p>

<p>Dillan and Ashley enjoy helping other people. They spent a Saturday morning packing food to send to Haiti along with our church. We didn&#8217;t make them – they could have stayed home with Lesa and the younger boys but they wanted to help. We had a tornado touch down in the area and Dillan and Ashley busted butt hauling logs and debris to help an elderly couple dig out from under. It was hard work and a long day and they volunteered to do that as well. They didn&#8217;t complain, or want to quit, or ask to stop. We&#8217;re so proud of them for the way they worked and for wanting to help others when they can.</p>

<p>We are considering buying a new house or maybe just adding another room and bathroom to our existing house. Dillan wants us to buy a farm. Ashley wants to live in town so she can have girl playmates. We want a basement so the kids have a larger indoor area to play in. We haven&#8217;t decided what to do yet but the kids have a say in the things we do – to a point of course.</p>

<p>We go to church every Sunday, it&#8217;s rare when we don&#8217;t. I teach Adult Sunday School and teach on a rotational basis in Junior Church once a month. I never teach to the kids when I&#8217;m teaching, instead I let them interact with other teachers and adults. But I do get to observe them. They absolutely love church.</p>

<p>I shot a monster buck on our property last fall and all the kids helped me haul it using a garden wagon. We weren&#8217;t sure if they would like venison after seeing where it came from but we&#8217;re happy they all love it. They are aware of where their food comes from and they don&#8217;t balk much when it comes to eating. If anything, it is vegetables they shy away from. We eat fish regularly and they like fish as well.</p>

<p>Dinner time is special. It is where we are always a family and the kids get to tell us about their day, or troubles, or whatever. We are all present and we take turns going first based on the day of week. We tried to set the example early so in their teen years they&#8217;ll know they always have people and a safe place they can confide in.</p>

<p>The kids have a lot friends and they are happy. We love the kids. They love us. Our extended family loves the kids and the kids love them. We have a lot of get-togethers and reunions and the kids like those as well. They are not growing up isolated. They know how families work. They know families can be messy. They are happy to be a part of our family and love them as much as us.</p>

<p>Once again, I asked the kids if they wanted to say anything to you and Dillan and Ashley both said yes. I had them sit at the table and write you. What they wrote is uncoached and unedited, and their own words and thoughts. Ashley wrote &#8220;please write back” but we must tell you if you do write back your letters will be vetted by us. We will decide if, and when, it gets past us and into their hands.</p>

<p>We have not told them about Drayden. We don&#8217;t want them asking us why Nicolle is keeping him and not them. We can&#8217;t answer that. Someday they will know, and I guarantee they will ask.</p>

<p>In summary, we love the kids! They are incredible! Even when it&#8217;s hard and they act up we feel blessed!</p>

<h3 id="dillan">Dillan</h3>

<p>Dillan is eight years old now and in third grade. He did great the first semester. He made Honor Roll, his reading and math were right on target. He got a Student of the Week award for bringing his Spelling grades up. Then came Christmas Break. He has had trouble focusing ever since. He is fidgeting and easily distracted and doesn&#8217;t seem to like school anymore. His grades are suffering and he is struggling. His last report card showed improvement from the previous. We don&#8217;t have his iRead or iStep scores yet so we&#8217;re not exactly sure where he&#8217;s at compared to his classmates. Currently his grades are As to Cs which are not all that bad but a long way from what he was doing first semester. Dillan should be okay and able to advance to the fourth grade. He seems to like Social Studies the best after gym, recess, and lunch of course. Dillan has shown an interest in playing guitar. He was introduced to it in Music class and he has mentioned playing guitar on multiple occasions. We are thinking about getting him a guitar and maybe asking someone from church to work with him to see if he has an aptitude for it or not. He likes and is good at art also. He had an art project displayed during the school art fair.</p>

<p>Dillan may have ADHD. His teachers and the school would like us to have him tested but we are resistant. We don&#8217;t want him taking drugs that may affect who he is as a person. We would rather use diet, exercise, and other methods to help him stay focused. When he is focused he does quite well. We&#8217;re amazed and pleased at his reading and he can easily do math when he wants, but the next day he might have trouble even doing simple math problems. Dillan sometimes acts younger than he is but that is certainly not always the case. He shows levels of maturity at times that takes us by surprise. I would have to say Dillan is growing up and experiencing growing pains along the way. I don&#8217;t know how else to explain it. He has grown emotionally quite a bit over the past year. He has an angry streak at times but he is usually, and by nature, a sweet and kind-hearted person. We love him a lot and don&#8217;t want to change who he is but we do take care to guide what he does and try to help him develop skills he&#8217;ll need.</p>

<p>Besides regular old playing, Dillan&#8217;s favorite activity is Scouts. He loves Scouts. He has many friends in Scouts that carry over into school. He enjoys the activities as well. He learned knife safety and earned his whittling badge which means he&#8217;s allowed to carry a pocket knife to Scout events. He&#8217;s proud of that. He also has a BB gun and is a good shot. We practice shooting a lot. He&#8217;s been camping, fishing, hiking, volunteered for community service, participated in parades. He placed second in his troop at the Pinewood Derby this year. Dillan thinks Scouting is awesome and he has a blast.</p>

<p>Dillan played Little League baseball last year, his team came in second overall. He is playing again this year, and his skills have improved a lot since last year. Pretty decent at hitting and throwing and not too bad at catching either. He has a good time and likes playing ball. In fourth grade he&#8217;ll be eligible to play basketball and has already asked us if he can. We&#8217;ll allow it if he can keep his grades up. Last summer he earned his swimming certificate. Dillan loves the pool. Dillan has put miles on his bike and literally wore out his tires. We ice skated again this year, he&#8217;s good at it, he still likes to go fast. He participated in a 5K walk-run event at school. Dillan is competitive. Dillan is physically awkward at times like any other boy his age but he does well athletically most of the time.</p>

<p>Dillan is tall. Almost as tall as Lesa. He&#8217;ll be taller than me for sure when he&#8217;s done growing. Dillan still likes to eat. Aside from getting bigger, he has become more aware. He is paying attention to what we do. He is piecing things together. He understands why we go to work every day, the money we earn, and the things money enables us to have and do. He&#8217;s starting to manage his own money. He&#8217;s beginning to realize there are relationships between things – cause and effect. He&#8217;s smart. Maybe not on a report card but there is no doubt he is smart. But at the end of the day he is still an eight-year-old kid that likes to play. He likes LEGOs, games, cars, television, Transformers, monster trucks, racing, video games, super heroes, all the typical boy stuff. He has a tablet that he can play on but he must do chores to earn tablet time. Weekends only, no tablet during the school week. Lesa has the tablet set up to where he must read an online book for 15 minutes before it lets him play games – he usually plays Minecraft.</p>

<p>Dillan got his dirt bike this year. We have plenty of room for him to ride. When he first started to ride he would power through turns instead of braking and he twice wound up in the bushes. As a result, he became afraid of it. I wasn&#8217;t sure if he would get back on. I loaded it on the trailer and we went to one of my friends. He worked with him and it helped having someone other than me guide him. No pressure or worries about performing for me. He loves riding and rides like a champ now. It&#8217;s a 90cc Yamaha and has plenty of juice. He takes it through rough stuff easy enough. He&#8217;s strong enough not to dump it and skilled enough not to stall it. He&#8217;ll be riding for life. We just picked up a new used helmet with wicked graphics that he likes. Now he thinks he&#8217;s big enough to ride the mower – but I won&#8217;t let him yet. I do let him start the truck though.</p>

<p>Dillan has stopped believing in Santa but is too afraid to out-and-out say so just in case Santa is real. He suspects it&#8217;s us but we keep telling him we&#8217;re too broke and he&#8217;s too rotten for us to be buying all those gifts. He goes along with it because he wants to make sure he gets gifts but secretly he&#8217;s not buying the whole flying reindeer and Santa down the chimney thing.</p>

<p>Dillan doesn&#8217;t talk about his biological family anymore. He doesn&#8217;t ask questions like he used to. I think he&#8217;s simply content with is his life right now. When we ask if he&#8217;s happy he immediately replies yes. He can be quiet but it does appear to us he is happy and likes being here. He most definitely loves us and he lets us know in words and in actions. Dillan envisions a future with us &#8211; he&#8217;s not in limbo. He talks about fixing up my old truck for when he&#8217;s old enough to drive and talks about stuff we can together and places we can go as a family. Dillan is part of our family, he knows he is loved and wanted. None of our family treats any of the kids as outsiders and never have. Wherever we are at Dillan will always feel like he is home.</p>

<p>One word to describe Dillan is kind-hearted.</p>

<h3 id="ashley">Ashley</h3>

<p>Ashley is seven years old and is in second grade. Ashley performs awesome in school. Ashley won top honors when she was awarded the Citizenship award last year – just one per grade – it&#8217;s a big deal. She makes straight As, makes Honor Roll consistently, has perfect attendance, given several Student of the Week awards, and is an excellent reader. She is smart and she knows it.</p>

<p>She likes to be better than everyone else and that alienates her sometimes. She makes friends easily and she literally knows everyone in the whole school, plus their older siblings that don&#8217;t even go to her school, and their parents too. Almost everyone is a friend to Ashley and we&#8217;ve had to stress to her that not everyone is a friend and have taught her what to do and watch out for. Ashley is reading the Little House on the Prairie books unprompted and unaided just because she wants too. She reads the Bible too. She can read and write cursive already; she&#8217;s not great at it but pretty good for a 7-year-old. Math is easy for her.</p>

<p>Like Dillan, Ashley has trouble focusing at times. Instead of fidgeting, she likes to talk. She talks to her friends, she butts into other people&#8217;s conversations, she blurts out answers in class, and she&#8217;ll tell anyone how it should be. If you disagree she&#8217;ll argue and try to use logic to prove you wrong. Except with me. She&#8217;s a princess and she thinks I&#8217;m the best. She loves Lesa too.</p>

<p>She fights with the boys over everything and beats them. Whether it&#8217;s a battle of wits or a battle of brawn she usually wins. Even if Dillan gets more physical she turns on the tears and tries to win that way. Everyone calls her DQ (drama queen). Even with all that she is an absolute sweetheart. We love her. She is the first one to think of others, to share, to give gifts, etc. She spends hours making everyone gifts, for no special reason, just because she loves them so much.</p>

<p>She is all girl. She likes pink and purple, sparkly things, dresses – especially if they fly out when she is twirling around, perfume, nail polish, body lotion, bubble baths, bows and ribbons and hair ties, shoes, jewelry, and fancy pants and socks. She dresses herself and has her own unique colorful style. She likes to write, draw, color, make us love notes, make slime, and most any other art or craft. She is very artistic and had two projects on display during the school art fair.</p>

<p>Ashley joined the Pep team this year. She got to go to the games and cheer her team on. She had a lot of fun doing that. She was chosen for her enthusiasm and on whether she could keep grades up. Ashley is also in Scouts. She likes Girl Scouts and has a lot of fun doing activities with them. She has been in parades also, and she went to Disney on Ice, and some other outings with them. She sometimes envies the Boy Scout activities and outings because she says they have more fun.</p>

<p>Ashley had no problem getting her swimming certification. She&#8217;s a natural, jumps off the highest diving board and we must tell her to take breaks because she doesn&#8217;t want to stop. She loves the pool and beach. She is a good ice skater also. She doesn&#8217;t go as fast, but she works on turns and spins and tries going backward. Ashley likes riding her bike, and she likes the swing set, mostly swinging. Ashley completed the entire 5k run/walk this year. She trained and was determined and she didn&#8217;t give up. Most things come easy to Ashley but she had to be strong and persevere on the 5k. She is playing baseball again this year but mostly so she doesn&#8217;t miss out on anything.</p>

<p>Ashley is all in on Santa, gets totally excited, and wants everything. She wanted dolls and critters this year, things she can care for, and be a mother to. She still wants rabbits and I&#8217;m making plans to build her a hutch and get her two does. Our hope is she&#8217;ll take caring for rabbits a step further and get involved in 4-H, and if not rabbits, maybe goats. She wants a horse but we&#8217;re not going to get her one anytime soon. We have chickens but she views them as livestock and doesn&#8217;t take any interest. She is not squeamish and is the one who will try to bait the hook or kill the spider. Ashley is interested in our garden, fruit, and flowers. She helped me make jam. Lesa has been teaching her to cook and she made me eggs over easy for breakfast on my birthday. Ashley wants to do everything. Learn piano, take gymnastics and dance and cheer, read, play, animals, and on and on. We&#8217;re trying to get her to focus on couple of things and excel at those and then expand from there.</p>

<p>Ashley doesn&#8217;t care much about her biological family – that was another life a million years ago. She If she asks anything she wants to know how many cousins she has. She loves our family and extended family and my nieces have taken her under their wing. One of my nieces had a baby recently and Ashley has been very involved with the baby. Ashley grows tired of her brothers and has repeatedly asked us to adopt a girl so she can have a sister. Not happening! Ashley wants to take care of animals and kids and her husband when she grows up. We&#8217;ve heard vet, doctor, teacher, wife, and she plans on being all of them. She still says she&#8217;ll have one boy, one girl, and adopt a child. Ashley trusts us, and confides in us, and she loves us both with all her heart. And we love her even more than she loves us.</p>

<p>One word to describe Ashley is princess.</p>

<h3 id="dwyane">Dwyane</h3>

<p>Dwyane is five years old and is in kindergarten. He loves kindergarten. He considers every one of his classmates, male and female, his friend and they all like him as well. Dwyane likes his teacher too. Dwyane has the same teacher Dillan and Ashley had and she wants to teach Bruce as well. Dwyane is doing well in school. He can read and write appropriately for his age. He knows his numbers, counting, his</p>

<p>coins, etc. We have no concerns with his schooling at all. He doesn&#8217;t get grades because he is in kindergarten but all his report cards are satisfactory. He is doing just fine in school.</p>

<p>Dwyane has discovered the world is a big place and filled with cool and interesting stuff and he doesn&#8217;t want to miss any of it. He wants to do everything. A lot of things can get Dwyane excited. Dwyane is more in tune with his feelings and can be a little sensitive at times. He&#8217;ll cross his arms and hang his head and pout when he doesn&#8217;t get his way – he doesn&#8217;t throw a fit but comes close. He gets ov</p>

<p>er it quickly and is himself again and acts like it never happened. Dwyane makes friends easy. He&#8217;ll usually share with his neighbors and help them. He likes to help Lesa. All the kids like to help us.</p>

<p>One word to describe Dwyane is gentleman. Dwyane is transitioning from a &#8220;little kid” into a &#8220;big kid” and he likes being a big kid. He tries to act older and do the things big kids do. He can&#8217;t wait to be in Scouts. He wants to stay up later. He wants the &#8220;Age 8 and Up” toys even though he&#8217;s five. He likes the idea of being grown up. He tries to emulate his big brother Dillan – for better or worse.</p>

<p>Dwyane likes cars and trucks but he likes building stuff even more. He loves to play with DUPLO and LEGO blocks, and some other building-type toys he got for Christmas. He likes toys that let him build things. Dwyane likes music and likes to dance. Dwyane fancies himself a good dancer. He isn&#8217;t shy. We could be anywhere and if he hears music he likes he&#8217;ll just start dancing. He has the moves. Dwyane also like to dress well and look good and he&#8217;ll strike a pose and ask if he looks sharp. Dwyane is cool.</p>

<p>Dwyane is physically active like the other kids. He doesn&#8217;t need training wheels and rides his bike fine without them. Dwyane passed his swimming lessons last summer and got his swimming certificate. He likes the pool and beach and it is one of his favorite summer activities. He likes to play on playgrounds too. Dwyane played baseball last year and he wanted to play again this year so we signed him up. He loves to bat and run the bases but mostly plays in the dirt the rest of the time. That&#8217;s okay, he&#8217;s having fun and learning at the same time. Dwyane can ice skate without our help. He&#8217;ll start out with us helping the first couple of laps and then he&#8217;ll tell us he can do it without help and off he goes skating the rest of the time. He went roller skating but didn&#8217;t do as well. He had a blast sledding this winter.</p>

<p>Dwyane loves life. Every day is a good day for him. He is always happy – unless he is sick which isn&#8217;t very often. He likes school, his siblings, our animals, our house, his toys, the things we do, church and us. He loves us – he&#8217;ll tell you Lesa is the best and I&#8217;m the second best – but he also loves God and Jesus for creating us. Dwyane is the cutest kid ever. He is always smiling and happy. He is the smallest of the bunch but has the biggest heart. He often thinks of others and can emphasize with people. Every morning he tells us to be careful and have a great day at work. We can&#8217;t help but love Dwyane.</p>

<p>Dwyane has most definitely come out of the shell he was in when he first came to live with us. He is outgoing and confident now. We love that he has overcome. He is completely at home. He doesn&#8217;t remember any of his biological family and doesn&#8217;t really care because that simply doesn&#8217;t make any sense to him – we are his mom and dad and that is the natural order of things for him.</p>

<h3 id="bruce">Bruce</h3>

<p>Bruce is four years old and in preschool. He doesn&#8217;t really like preschool. He doesn&#8217;t like being with the &#8220;little babies” either and wants to be with the &#8220;big kids” and do what they do. He does well with preschool when he decides to do preschool. We told him if he didn&#8217;t follow instructions and do well during his kindergarten screening he would have to stay with the babies even longer. He decided to put forth the effort and started following his teachers&#8217; instructions. We&#8217;re happy for Bruce because he will be going to kindergarten this fall and he will like it much better than preschool.</p>

<p>Bruce has been an independent fellow this year. Bruce wants to do what Bruce wants to do. He doesn&#8217;t care about the consequence. About the only person he listens to is me. Everyone else he tells no or I don&#8217;t want to. We thought he was going to get kicked out of preschool this past year because he was disrupting others. They worked with him and we&#8217;re being told that Bruce has made a turn for the better and is now one of the more behaved kids. We&#8217;re not sure we believe them yet.</p>

<p>Bruce loves to aggravate his siblings. Because of that they don&#8217;t want to play with him which makes him aggravate them even more. Being in school will sort of level the playing field and that kind of behavior will die down if not go away. Bruce hates being the youngest. If you make the mistake and call him the baby brother you&#8217;ll get an ear full. He&#8217;ll say &#8220;I am not! I&#8217;m the youngest.” Bruce is a fighter and he is tough. He holds his own with all his siblings. He won&#8217;t be pushed around.</p>

<p>He is also the cut-up, clown, jester, comedian of the bunch. He has a great since of humor. He likes to laugh and joke and make others laugh and joke. He&#8217;s just four but he is sharp and witty and fast on his feet with a reply if you try to match wits with him. We like that about him. He makes us laugh too even though he can try our patience at times. When meeting new people, he&#8217;ll hide behind us and act shy, but Bruce is not shy at all. Wait a couple of minutes and he&#8217;ll be himself.</p>

<p>One word to describe Bruce is mischievous. Bruce is a completely different person one-on-one. When you&#8217;re alone with Bruce he becomes helpful, calmer, and you can have a conversation with him. The mischievous is gone and a loving little boy appears. I especially like the one-on-one Bruce because he is my buddy and we can talk easily and he&#8217;s fun to hang out with.</p>

<p>Bruce mostly plays with cars and trucks. He likes monster trucks a lot. He wants to watch them on YouTube and/or TV all the time. Bruce&#8217;s favorite toy is whatever toy his siblings are playing with which he&#8217;ll try to take. He hates wearing shoes. He&#8217;d go barefoot everywhere all year long if you let him. He doesn&#8217;t like to put on a coat either. To him shoes and coats are a bother and slow him down.</p>

<p>Bruce loves snow and sledding. He likes riding his bike but hates the training wheels even though he still needs them. Bruce also passed his swimming test last summer and got his swimming certificate. He likes the pool and beach like all the others. He cannot ice skate without our help yet but he is close. Bruce likes to play in mud and water. He&#8217;s always splashing around in a puddle getting wet and muddy. Bruce is playing baseball this year, coach pitch, and he&#8217;s a decent hitter. He throws great and he can stop the ball if not catch it. He has fun playing.</p>

<p>Bruce has no clue what adoption is although he&#8217;s heard it from his siblings lots of times. It doesn&#8217;t register with him yet. We are mom and dad and he loves us like all little boys love their mom and dad and we love him like our very own.</p>
