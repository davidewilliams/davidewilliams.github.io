      <description>Worked until 3a last night / this morning, didn&amp;#8217;t get much sleep and when I did I dreamed about work, back at work by 9a and worked until 8:30p tonight &amp;#8211; finally got my patch out the door. I&amp;#8217;m exhausted! Put in 36.5 hours in the last three days! Considering I was on Spring Break Monday and Tuesday that&amp;#8217;s a good deal, only using 3.5 hours of PTO which leaves me over a week of vacation in the bank.</description>

      <description>Worked from home, started at 8am, finished at midnight, took a lunch and dinner break, a 15 hour workday, but I got my patch out. Will need to go into the office tomorrow to test and install. Hoping to spend as little as possible in the office and going to bring a lot home with me. Ashley upset with the boys over a fort in the woods they destroyed supposedly to make it better which never happened.</description>

      <description>Went into work, Lesa got up with me, kids still sleeping when I left. Lesa home for the next 45 days or so. I wound up working until 5:30 and then I went to Walmart with Lesa&amp;#8217;s grocery list. Finally got home at 8:30pm with a truckload of supplies. Lesa is worried for my health and possible exposure to COVID-19. Lesa said the kids did okay but there was more friction between her and Ashley but not out-and-out fighting.</description>

      <description>Last day of Spring Break for me. Lesa had a video conference with work, she&amp;#8217;s considered essential personnel, will round-robin Wednesdays with her co-workers and work from home the remainder of the time, and she&amp;#8217;ll get time-and-a-half when she does go into the office. I still have the desecration to work from home if I wish and am exempt from Governor&amp;#8217;s restrictions because I&amp;#8217;m a Department of Defense employee. It helps knowing our paychecks and jobs are secure for a while.</description>

      <description>Slow morning. Lesa gave me an Amazon FireTV Stick she got from somewhere? I got it working and it&amp;#8217;s just barely usable but it is usable. Watched a movie but I don&amp;#8217;t remember the name. Nice day so we all got out, Ashley read a book on the deck. Lesa, the boys, and myself got a lot of the recyclables together and I hauled a crap ton of plastic bottles. Took the kids with because the risk was low and there was no contact with people or things.</description>

      <description>Church was live-streamed although we didn&amp;#8217;t watch. Instead we did our own church, sang songs, and Lesa had a lesson for us. It worked out pretty good. Made it to Lowe&amp;#8217;s and got the right faucet. I went to Aldi&amp;#8217;s looking for TP, milk, pizza rolls, chicken tenders, and mashed potatoes &amp;#8211; had nada. Went to Walmart and they had everything but the mashed potatoes. Got home and fixed the faucet.</description>

      <description>Tried to sleep in, didn&amp;#8217;t happen. Ashley made me coffee and Lesa made me breakfast. Bruce was horsing in the kitchen or maybe helping, I&amp;#8217;m not sure which, but he ran into Lesa who had a pan and he surface burned his arm on the pan, sunburn is worse and he didn&amp;#8217;t phase him. I went to Lowe&amp;#8217;s to get an outdoor faucet because Dillan broke ours, don&amp;#8217;t ask me how, I don&amp;#8217;t know.</description>

      <description>Repeat of yesterday. I went into Scientia, only one there half the day, one other co-worker came in. Lesa worked from home and watched the kids. All the kids except Dillan have their homework packets done. Mrs Malone called and talked to Ashley. Lesa took the kids to Springville Elementary playground, then to Springville Park, then to the park by Johnny&amp;#8217;s Junction &amp;#8211; each time they left when other people arrived.</description>

      <description>Ate breakfast with the family and then I went to work. Started at SAIC and then headed to Scientia, just two of us in the office, worked a 9-hour day. One of my co-workers was hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms and difficulty breathing, scary sh*t. Picked up another letter from Daniel. Lesa worked from home and watched the kids. Sounds like it went mostly okay. Ashley said she didn&amp;#8217;t fight with Lesa at all, Lesa didn&amp;#8217;t say otherwise so proud of both of them.</description>

      <description>Day two of working from home. Lesa went in again today. Didn&amp;#8217;t get near the same done as I did yesterday. Since got stuff running though so by end of the day I&amp;#8217;ll have my time in. It rained all day long so the kids were stuck inside. Ashley&amp;#8217;s throat still raw but got better as the day went on, tea and honey helped. Dillan took a half hour rinse off shower and I had to yell at him to get out, Bruce &amp;#8220;accidentally&amp;#8221; shut Dwyane&amp;#8217;s hand in the door, and Bruce &amp;#8220;accidentally&amp;#8221; stepped on Ashley &amp;#8211; all before 10am!</description>

      <description>Lesa went into work, I worked from home and watched the kids. I got 7.5 hours of work done which is kind of amazing considering. In the morning the boys went outside and played in the mud until I chased them out of the yard and into the woods to dig. Ashley played in her room with &amp;#8230; well, I&amp;#8217;m not sure what. We had Vienna Sausages for lunch, their pick, I ate the barbecue ones, had pop-cycles afterward.</description>

      <description>Bizarre day to say the least. Lesa went into work. I got kids ready and took them to daycare and then I went into work. Not many people at work, one co-worker came in, said he didn&amp;#8217;t feel well, and left. Two others left midday leaving me by myself. I worked a full day and then picked up the kids. Annetta said they were all good and the next time they&amp;#8217;re at daycare she&amp;#8217;ll get them some ice cream.</description>

      <description>I woke up in a fever, took my temp, it was okay. Church canceled Sunday School, evening worship, Wednesday activities, everything but 10:30 worship service. They live-streamed the service. They also changed the way we do communion and offering. Pretty sparse attendance. We kept the kids with us. Right after church we went to Walmart and stocked up on more stuff. Couldn&amp;#8217;t find cereal or bread so hit three Dollar Generals on the way home from Walmart and still didn&amp;#8217;t find any.</description>

      <description>Stayed home all morning. I was listening to Flatt &amp;amp; Scruggs Live at Neely Auditorium on Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN from May 2, 1963 and that kind of got the kids fired up. It turned into YouTube and hip-hop and others, and that of course turned into dancing and videos. The pinewood derby was supposed to be today but was canceled so we did something different. Played Words with Friends game (it&amp;#8217;s like Scrabble) with Ashley and only beat her by 6 points.</description>

      <description>School and work. Had a hard time getting motivated at work. Was going to leave early but wound up staying later. School robocalled to say school is closed due to COVID-19 and won&amp;#8217;t be open until April. When I picked up kids I talked to Jessica about what we could expect daycare to do and it looks like unless sickness hits them it will be an option for us. Both our workplaces are being flexible so I think we&amp;#8217;ll be okay.</description>

      <description>School and work. Lots of COVID-19 talk everywhere, it&amp;#8217;s on everyone&amp;#8217;s mind, most people trying not to panic, some people are simply idiots. Wondering whether we should cancel our Spring Break trip, Lesa looking to me to keep us all safe, kids are blissfully unaware of the danger. Getting pressure to step up my game at work; the office is more than half empty. Ditto for Lesa&amp;#8217;s work, many people wanting to or already are working from home.</description>

      <description>Woke up exhausted, didn&amp;#8217;t want to get up, finally did. Stayed exhausted throughout the day, wound up working over even so. Jason texted and wanted to come to our house to cut pinewood derby cars, got home and he was already waiting in our drive, we cut the cars and the boys painted already, I polished the axles so they might go faster. Lesa went and got milk after dinner. Kids on devices or taking showers.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school. Spent the entire day at SAIC. Lesa back at work, sent me email IU is closing classes after Spring Break and almost everyone will be working remotely. Pulled a nine hour day and then picked up kids from daycare, I&amp;#8217;m utterly exhausted. Slept much of the evening on the couch. Kids watched television and played and made much noise which irritated me. Jason Sowder was going to cut pinewood derby cars for me and the boys but cancelled earlier in the afternoon, hopefully tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school. Worked half a day at Scientia, other half at SAIC. Lesa took the day off, DST blues. She went shopping for supplies, hopefully enough to get us through two weeks of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic but I doubt it. No troubles at school or daycare. Picked kids up and came home, Lesa had supper made. We ate and I took the boys to Cub Scouts. Dwyane packed care packages for the Bedford Police Department.</description>

      <description>Everyone more tired than usual due to DST and losing an hour. Went to church, didn&amp;#8217;t serve or teach. After lunch Lesa went to Rural King in Bedford looking for a larger drop pan which they didn&amp;#8217;t have, and she went to CVS as well. Ashley had a meltdown over her birthday and the amount of gifts she can have. The kids rode bikes a lot, it was a beautiful day.</description>

      <description>Lazy-ish morning. Took the kids and went to Fayetteville to sign up boys for baseball, considering softball for Ashley. Kids played in giant sand pile while I did paperwork and got themselves filthy, then dumped their shoes and pants in the truck, Bruce on the seat. We all went to Dillan&amp;#8217;s basketball game, I had to leave with Ashley after the third quarter to take her to Amanda&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8211; they&amp;#8217;re going to Kroger on Liberty Drive for their last Girl Scout cookie booth, she sold 144 boxes her share for a total of 506 boxes.</description>

      <description>Friday, dropped kids off, Lesa and I both worked, I was in Bloomington today. Lesa got off early, went grocery shopping, then picked up the boys from daycare. She came home, put up groceries, and took the boys to Burger King for supper. Then off to Mom and Son Nerf Wars at 1st Baptist in Bedford! They had Nerf gun fights, obstacle courses, bouncy houses, snacks and drinks. They had a blast, didn&amp;#8217;t even want to leave to go to Jiffy Treat.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school, Dillan had his poster. Worked at SAIC all day. Bruce ate lunch in the office, Mr Hudson wasn&amp;#8217;t there, missed recess too. Stopped by PO Box on a whim and had two letters from Daniel, didn&amp;#8217;t get the usual notification I had mail. Picked up kids from daycare, nothing unusual there, Ashley upset she didn&amp;#8217;t get rewarded for cleaning up. Kind of cold outside so kids stayed in.</description>

      <description>I took kids to the bus stop and came back home. Lesa and I both went to talk to Dwyane&amp;#8217;s Speech Therapist Darren Swango at Springville Elementary. Got to hear the kids announcements. Dwyane is doing really good, intermittent trouble with sh sounds. Afterward we talked about Dillan&amp;#8217;s speech, he can pronounce sounds okay but tends to go to fast, run words together, and kind of mumbles his words making him difficult to understand &amp;#8211; don&amp;#8217;t we know it!</description>

      <description>Dropped kids at school. Went to work, Kind of a nerve-racking day. Really nice outside. Picked up kids, no major daycare issues to speak of, Bruce did get mouthy with Jessica so we talked about that. Dillan put hands on a kid at school and got called out for it by Mr Hudson. Kids played outside until dinner. Dillan said Ashley has a thing for his friend Bo from school so we teased her about it.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school, Ashley had a big box of cookies. Work, ugh! Nice day temp-wise but rained most of the day, thunder and lightning as I type this. Kathy Mitchell came to work and got her cookies from me. I picked up kids and headed home. Boys didn&amp;#8217;t want to go to Cub Scouts but we kind of made them, once there they had fun per usual. Ashley&amp;#8217;s tooth hurting from her spacer and she&amp;#8217;s been complaining about it.</description>

      <description>Skipped church, multiple people messaging wanting to know if we&amp;#8217;re okay &amp;#8211; we are. Slept until my Sunday alarm which hardly ever happens &amp;#8211; the kids or Lesa or the dogs almost always wake me up before. Ashley and me cooked breakfast for Lesa, Dwyane, and ourselves. Ashley, Dwyane, and myself played Yahtzee. Planned on doing something outdoors like hiking but it never happened. Kids rode bikes, Ashley and me mucked Oreo and Blackie&amp;#8217;s hutch, Lesa did some yard work so we were outdoors.</description>

      <description>Everyone slept in a bit longer than usual &amp;#8211; usual is 6-7, today 7-8. Lazy morning, turned on radio, then got song requests, then the dancing. Lesa and Ashley went to get their hair cut, everyone booked up, even Walmart. Went to Taco Bell for lunch. Boys watched TV and I took a nice hot shower. Haircuts a bust so girls came home. Boys and myself had lunch. We all went to Walmart to get shoes and soup, weird combination.</description>

      <description>Dropped kids at school, Bruce took his big helicopter for Show-and-Tell. Work. Took off late and went to the bank to deposit Girl Scout cookie checks, then Dollar General for Mt. Dews and antifreeze, losing 1&amp;frasl;2 a gallon a day, don&amp;#8217;t see a leak so it must be going out the tailpipe. Picked up kids from daycare. Lesa grocery shopped after work and we helped her carry in. Then everyone went into cleaning mode while Lesa got supper together &amp;#8211; we had pizza &amp;#8211; it is Friday night after all.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school, side roads were really slick and icy, the main roads were not as bad. Got to work about 10 minutes late, worked until 4:30 and headed to pick up kids. Warmed up to where I didn&amp;#8217;t worry about the roads. My heater was blowing cold air, I lost a gallon of coolant in a day&amp;#8217;s time, going to have to check that out, hope it&amp;#8217;s not a head gasket but kind of suspect it could be.</description>

      <description>Didn&amp;#8217;t snow that bad, roads were fine. Lesa off, and I took a half day. We dropped kids off at the bus stop and then we headed to Bloomington for Lesa&amp;#8217;s colonoscopy. She did fine, was a little confused after coming too, then a bit dizzy/weak until she ate something. It started snowing harder come noon and I wound up just taking the whole day off. Picked up the kids from school and we ate supper then I took all the kids to Minute to Win It at church.</description>

      <description>Rained in the morning but finally stopped. Now we&amp;#8217;re expecting a winter storm &amp;#8211; snow and ice overnight. Somehow managed to make the entire day at work, won&amp;#8217;t say I actually worked the entire day. Took kids to school of course. Wreck was still on the kid&amp;#8217;s mind. Lesa prepped for her colonoscopy, has to be there by 8am in the morning and she&amp;#8217;s really stressing over it. Got mad at Dillan over his grades.</description>

      <description>Rainy days and Mondays. Got kids to school okay. Went to SAIC, stayed all day. I&amp;#8217;m sick, have a cold, my nose is runny and my head stopped up, being sick sucks. Left SAIC early and picked up kids from school and headed home and took a nap while the kids watched TV. Lesa got home and we ate supper. The boys had a Pack meeting, Bruce did a skit with his den mates.</description>

      <description>Up late last night, tired all day. Lesa kept letting the dogs in and out of the bedroom and I didn&amp;#8217;t even get to sleep until my alarm went off. Lesa stayed home from church, I was lockup deacon so we were the last ones out. Went home, got changed, and ate lunch. Dillan, Ashley, Bruce and myself went to the Tusseys. From there we went to Linda and Gordon Andersons&amp;#8217; house and picked up two huge turkeys.</description>

      <description>Got up at 9, amazing! Ashley made me eggs-in-a-basket and Lesa made me coffee, I am loved. Took Ashley to Johnny&amp;#8217;s Junction and handed her off to Amanda. They did a cookie booth at Kroger on South Walnut in Bloomington, and then they went to Wendy&amp;#8217;s for lunch, and then to Amanda&amp;#8217;s to drop off cookies, and then they went to World Thinking Day in Williams, Indiana. Sounds like she had a lot of fun.</description>

      <description>The kids pissed me off so bad this morning. They are total butts! I sent them into school without a hug or kiss. First time I&amp;#8217;ve ever done that. Worked at SAIC all day, it sucked. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to pick the kids up come quitting time. First time I&amp;#8217;ve felt that way too. Asked Annetta what she would charge me to take them for the entire weekend. Stopped by TK, turned in paperwork and left a deposit.</description>

      <description>Lesa left kind of early even for her, wondered what was up with that. Got the kids ready and waited for the bus with them. Headed into work. At 11:36am, got a call, and my day was ruined. Went to SAIC to put out fires, mostly did so, but will be going back again tomorrow. Worked later than I wanted but finally got out and picked up the kids. Eastern Greene had their open house tonight and we went.</description>

      <description>Kids too slow getting ready, boys playing Nerf guns and watching TV instead of getting ready. Ashley dragging her feet a little bit as well but she has a lot more stuff to do. Dropped the kids at school and headed into work. It got a bit stressful come afternoon but not too bad. Left late at 5pm and picked up kids. Nothing planned or scheduled for the evening. Lesa helped all the kids with their homework.</description>

      <description>Got the kids up and ready for school, just made the bus, it was a bit early and we were a bit late &amp;#8211; Ashley had to go back in for her glasses. Lesa and I took the day off so I went back home and crawled back into bed. Got up at 9am and by 10 we were headed to Greenfield to check out TK Construction&amp;#8217;s Jackson model home. Got there before they opened so we ate lunch at O&amp;#8217;Charlies, we both had Atlantic Salmon but prepared differently, it was very tasty.</description>

      <description>President&amp;#8217;s Day, kids would normally have off but they have school to make up a snow day. Lesa worked and doesn&amp;#8217;t get the day off. I got the day off but worked anyway, and am trading it for tomorrow off. Lesa and I are going to tour the TK Jackson house in Greenfield &amp;#8211; they are closed Mondays. So, I worked all day at Scientia and was by myself all day, it was awesome.</description>

Ashley had her Riley prayer slot at noon and took the time to pray for Riley.</description>

      <description>Slept until 8 or so, kids started to make us breakfast in bed but we got up and requested breakfast at the table instead. That was sweet of them. Easy morning, was going to haul trash but that never happened. Kids did a lot of chores trying to earn tablet and computer time. Ashley and me took cookie money to Amanda and got more cookies. Had an issue with scheduling cookie booths but got that settled as well.</description>

I real quick had the kids sign their card to Lesa and we put her candy and cards in her spot. Everyone had something. Lesa left for work. I got the kids fed, drove them to school, and off to work I went.</description>

Kids stayed in truck until bus arrived. I got to work and just two of us there for the next hour. Ripped a couple of DVDs with tagged software and headed to SAIC. Spent the rest of the day there installing for EMI testing and have to go back in the morning.</description>

      <description>Rained nearly all day. Took kids to the bus stop per usual. Kids had a non-eventful day at school. Lesa worked and also just a normal day. Ditto for me, absolutely nothing happening. I did seem to get a lot of work done at least. Went to SAIC and installed latest development build and picked up several external drives to use for maps. Bought Mom/Son Nerf War tickets for Lesa and the boys from the Bedford Parks Department.</description>

Got back to Scientia and worked the day until late and then left to pick up the kids. Got home and ate supper. Took Ashley to Bedford North Lawrence for the varsity game, they honored elementary school basketball players and cheerleaders at halftime by allowing them onto the court. She met up with Mrs Davis and I tried to hang back.</description>

      <description>Back to work and school, thought I was going to go to SAIC but didn&amp;#8217;t, will be going in the morning. Kids wanted to go to school I think, I wonder if it&amp;#8217;s kind of comforting and relaxing for them, kind of like when Lesa and I feel like it&amp;#8217;s more peaceful at our desk than it is at home. I left at a reasonable time and picked up the kids.</description>

We went to church, I was really tired and had a hard time staying away, Ashley had a nightmare and woke me up really early &amp;#8211; plus I probably stayed up too late as well, got to sit with Dillan and Lesa for once. Unloaded more cookies and took some reorders. We went to Bedford after church, ate lunch at Taco Bell, and went to CVS for Lesa&amp;#8217;s script.</description>

      <description>Woke up to snow on the ground. Super busy day. Took Ashley to Rural King to sell Girl Scout cookies at 10am, didn&amp;#8217;t sell a lot of cookies, would do much better at a grocery store I think. Came home and ate lunch and we all went to Dillan&amp;#8217;s basketball game, he is doing well, a little nervous and shooting the ball a bit hard and could use work dribbling but not bad for his first time playing.</description>

      <description>Call at 5:40AM, school on a two-hour delay, let the kids sleep in a little, I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to fall back asleep. Lesa made it to work just fine, roads were clear, even the side roads, everyone I talked to had no issues and neither did I. Ran kids to daycare but they were understaffed and unable to drive the kids to school so back home we went. Later, back at the bus stop, the boys were playing and horsing around and just as the bus arrived Bruce face planted and busted his nose, lip and chin &amp;#8211; blood was gushing.</description>

      <description>Waited for the kids to get on the bus per usual. Ashley went on a field trip to the State House, she had a lot of fun. Picked the kids up from daycare, stopped at Dollar General to restock truck candy. At dinner Dillan recalled the time he went to the State House and him and Ashley sort of compared notes (tried to outdo each other), nothing too bad and mostly good-natured, Ashley does that a lot but this time Dillan was a bit jealous.</description>

      <description>Rained all last night and day, sloppy muddy out. Took kids to bus for school. One of the first into work and didn&amp;#8217;t leave until the very last minute. Just barely got the kids! Probably close to breaking even on time, I&amp;#8217;ll figure it up tomorrow. Ashley brought home a paper about her hero &amp;#8211; it was me! I needed a shirt and tie for the dance this Friday, so I tried to take Dwyane and Bruce with me.</description>

      <description>Bus, school, daycare for kids. Work for adults. Got off late trying to make up time for leaving early yesterday. Picked up kids near closing time and got home. No activities on the calendar and was going to take the boys and do something but didn&amp;#8217;t quite know what, so I opted to play Sorry with Dwyane and Bruce. They took showers so I played with one while the other was washing, Dillan and Ashley joined.</description>

      <description>Got kids up for school and fed, instead of the bus stop I drove them to school because Ashley had 3 boxes of Girl Scout cookies to hand out. Got off work early and picked up Ashley from school to go to the dermatologist. Barely! Nearly forgot and only just made it. Talked to Mr Hudson about the phone call we got from him last Friday concerning Bruce, nothing serious and no need to do anything.</description>

      <description>Lesa had kids fed when I got up, fixed me breakfast too. We went to church, Family Sunday but I was lead in back and also lobby security so didn&amp;#8217;t get to spend time with family. Had Dillan help again with communion and he did good. Ashley had all her Cincinnati Christian Girl Scout cookie orders and got most of them handed out and paid for. Kaleena called and asked Ashley to come down to play, Ashley ate lunch and got Springville cookie orders ready for Monday, and then went down.</description>

      <description>Slept in sort of, still got woke up by Bruce running through the house. My phone was just an expensive paperweight this morning, wouldn&amp;#8217;t power on or anything. Finally able to get it reset and it came on, not sure what that was all about but thought I was going to have to get another and redo everything, kind of scary how we depend on them things. Skipped breakfast for lunch instead.</description>

      <description>Took kids to bus, cold and wet out. Got donuts for work, it was payday Friday. Picked up kids from daycare. Lesa went grocery shopping. Message on the answering machine from Mr Hudson, Bruce was in his office for smacking another kid on the butt. Brought home sushi for Ashley to try, she liked some of it but not all, Dillan and Bruce tried some too and both of them liked they said, I wound up finishing.</description>

      <description>Bus stop, school, daycare for kids. Ashley wore one of the new outfits Lesa bought her. Lesa worked all day. I worked all day in Bloomington. Everyone is still healthy, just one more day to make an entire week, first time in three weeks. Picked kids up and Lesa already had supper ready. Lesa got Ashley to her Girl Scout meeting. I took Dillan to his basketball practice and then rushed to pick Ashley up and get back in time before practice ended, it rained most of the day and the roads were slick but I did okay.</description>

      <description>Got kids ready for school, breakfast of mostly left-over pancakes from yesterday&amp;#8217;s Bob Evan&amp;#8217;s meal, shipped them off to school on the bus. Headed to work. Lesa seemed to have a better day then she had yesterday while I felt blah all day. Had military big-wigs in the shop, everyone kind of hyper and anal about appearances, etc. Took off about 4:30p and left to get kids. Picked them up and no sooner were we in the truck when Dillan and Dwyane started fighting.</description>

      <description>Repeat of yesterday, took kids to bus stop, they went to school, everyone seems healthy, Bruce has a slight cough. I went to the Urologist again only this time I really did have an appointment, no issues, set appointment for next year, looking like enlarged prostate and elevated PSA is normal for me, Lesa and I both relieved no cancer for the moment. Lesa also went to see the doctor, didn&amp;#8217;t say why, she said routine stuff.</description>

      <description>Checked everyone&amp;#8217;s temps this morning, everyone okay to go to school, Bruce had a nose bleed getting ready, Lesa probably the sickest but she went to work too. I went to the Urologist in Bloomington, realized my appointment is for tomorrow, and drove all the way back to Bedford and worked at SAIC all day. Texted with Lesa, she had a rough day and didn&amp;#8217;t feel very well. I thought I was going to get sick myself a couple of times, didn&amp;#8217;t finish my coffee or eat breakfast.</description>

      <description>Got up, took Ashley, Dwyane and Bruce to church, Serving Deacon, traded home bound communion duties, didn&amp;#8217;t want to be the reason some old person got sick. Ashley made a lot of cookie sales at church. When we got back home I made everyone lunch, and then I made everyone take naps, even though they didn&amp;#8217;t want to everyone fell asleep right away and slept awhile. Lesa and Dillan are feeling better but no where near 100% yet, worried he&amp;#8217;ll still be sick in the morning and don&amp;#8217;t have a plan for that yet.</description>

Missed Dillan&amp;#8217;s first Courts for Christ basketball game. Made lunch. Did dishes. Did laundry. Made it to Ashley&amp;#8217;s first cookie booth, her share was 40 boxes sold! Made supper. Kids took showers. Played Sorry with boys and Lesa.</description>

      <description>All kids went to school, took them off to the bus stop and saw them off then headed to work. Lesa worked as well. Got a call at 10:30am, Dillan not feeling well and running a fever! F*ck! Can&amp;#8217;t catch a break! Lesa had a meeting and had to be at work, I had lunch at noon and it was mandatory as well. Rushed to Springville Elementary, in the rain, and got Dillan.</description>

      <description>Bruce slept the night through! No fever! Must have broke sometime during the night. Took the other three to the bus stop, and went to work. Lesa stayed home and watched Bruce. He&amp;#8217;ll go to school tomorrow unless something happens overnight. I went to Dr Thompson&amp;#8217;s office at 10am, fasted the entire time, supposed to just be lab work, waited 40 minutes and still didn&amp;#8217;t have my blood drawn, got mad and told them I&amp;#8217;d reschedule and call them later, and left.</description>

      <description>Bruce had a horrible night, he came out absolutely terrified, was starring at something no one else could see, and he was very confused. After 15-20 minutes I finally got him calmed down enough to where he could tell me what was wrong: a dinosaur came and it ate me and was after him. Slept with him on the couch for awhile, and finally got him settled and in his bed around 3:30am.</description>

      <description>More sickness! Dwyane 101° something and felt bad. Bruce 103.7° and Ibuprofen barely reduced it. Bruce got up multiple times last night. Lesa had to be at work so I took off to watch the boys. Took Dillan and Ashley to the bus stop and saw them off, went to Springville Store and got some Sprite and headed home. Tried to do so work but Bruce dry heaved half the morning, poor guy.</description>

      <description>Martin Luther King Junior Day and Lesa and I had off. The kids had school to make up a snow day so we were kid-free. I got up and got kids ready for school and took them to the bus stop. I went back to bed and slept all morning! Got up, we took showers, and went to Bloomington for lunch. We went to Asuka Japanese Steakhouse, Sushi &amp;amp; Noodles and did the Hibachi, first time experience for us, we had steak and shrimp with fried rice, and soup prior.</description>

After church, Shane Schroyer came out and checked our furnace, it was acting kind of odd a few weeks ago but seems to be okay. Bruce and then Dillan hung out with us to watch. After Shane left we had lunch.</description>

      <description>Slept in and a lazy morning, kids did some chores and workbooks to get tablet, computer, or Wii time. A lot of looking over the other&amp;#8217;s shoulder to see what the other was up to. After lunch we went to the library and saw the McCluskey&amp;#8217;s. I threw a fit over the books Dillan tends to get before we left and he picked two that were more age appropriate but I doubt he&amp;#8217;ll read them, will probably just backfire on me.</description>

      <description>Friday! Took kids to bus stop. Lesa and I had a date night and we both took off a little bit early from work. I picked up the kids and we headed to Bloomington. Todd and Paulette Davidson watched the kids for us so we could go out for dinner. It was awesome. We went to Red Lobster, or as Bruce called it, Red Hamsters. Had a fantastic dinner and then we went to the mall and walked around a bit, talked, joked about being the old people walking the mall for exercise.</description>

Lesa had supper ready per usual when we got home. Girl Scout meeting was canceled. I took Dillan to his first Courts for Christ basketball practice. Ashley went with, Lesa encouraged it. Lesa stayed home with boys doing I know not what. Dillan did okay for not having really played before.</description>

      <description>Took kids to bus stop. Lesa and I both worked. Worked a little over but not much. Picked up kids, almost sorry I did, little pills like usual. I&amp;#8217;m not really sorry of course, they are blessings but there are those times as I&amp;#8217;m sure every parent knows. Got home, no where to go tonight, thank goodness! Stayed home, watched TV, took showers and baths, did homework, the usual boring stuff.</description>

      <description>Dropped kids at bus stop, Lesa and I both worked. Dillan blew off career day, I suggested he draw some lines on paper and say he was going to be a criminal, he didn&amp;#8217;t like that so much. I worked until last minute and then left to get kids from daycare. No activities scheduled so kids watched an hour of TV. Ashley and me read some of the Bible and Dillan was listening in.</description>

      <description>Lesa worked. I took all four kids to the dentist first thing in the morning, before school started even. Dillan needs to brush better lower front and upper back. Ashley, Dwyane, and Bruce need to brush better along gum lines. Dentist didn&amp;#8217;t want to remove spacer and I&amp;#8217;m not sure what we&amp;#8217;re going to do yet. Took them to school afterward and then went to work myself. Lesa picked up the kids, I was at SAIC by then.</description>

      <description>Got up, took kids to church with me, Lesa stayed home. I was roaming deacon and Dillan roamed with me, he also shadowed/helped me serve communion in back. We kept the kids inside due to the rain, the ground is really saturated and everything is muddy and we didn&amp;#8217;t feel like dealing with the mess of four kids. Not sure having them inside was any better &amp;#8211; lots of fighting and aggravating each other, and us, per usual.</description>

      <description>Got up at 8a, got kids breakfast and dressed, and had them out the door by 9a. Went to the Springville Basketball Tournament, Ashley was a cheerleader, rest of us watched. We lost, and probably the last game for forever since they&amp;#8217;re shutting down the school. Went to Steak &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; Shake and had lunch with shakes to go. Tried to nap, kids did homework and chores depending on the kid. Lesa played Monopoly with the boys and I played Trouble with Ashley.</description>

      <description>Friday, it&amp;#8217;s been an exhausting week! Dropped off kids at bus stop and went into work. All of them seemed a little bit iffy except for Dillan, expected to get a call any time to come get one of them but they made it through the day. Got picked up from school by daycare. Lesa went grocery shopping and then picked up the kids on her way home. I went to the doctor&amp;#8217;s office after work for a six month followup and all seems well, need to drink more water and exercise more.</description>

      <description>Lesa watching sick kids, probably last day, they seem to be doing better. Took Dillan and Dwyane to bus stop. Coming back Dillan and Dwyane walked home from bus stop. Lesa and kids weren&amp;#8217;t getting along, especially Ashley. Issues, I got calls from Ashley saying Mommy was being mean, got calls from Lesa saying Ashley being mean, got another call from Ashley saying Lesa locked her out of the house, and another saying Lesa was following her everywhere with a video camera, f*ck my life!</description>

      <description>My day to take care of the sick kids again, got Dillan and Dwyane to the bus just fine. Let Ashley and Bruce sleep in late and when they did wake up I delivered software to SAIC, went to Dollar General to get some Gatorade for Bruce, and stopped by daycare and paid them. Got home, they didn&amp;#8217;t want breakfast, let them watch TV. Bruce threw up watching TV and got some on him and his blanket.</description>

      <description>I worked today. Took Dillan and Dwyane to the bus stop. Lesa stayed home with Ashley and Bruce. I forgot my phone, bad day for that, school called to let us know our kids were missing, super busy at work and needed to make lots of calls and had to borrow phones. Bruce threw up. Lesa stressed. Ashley full of drama. Daycare wanted doctor releases. Lesa had to call my boss to get a hold of me.</description>

      <description>Dillan woke us shortly after 2:00am and told us Bruce was screaming and crying. Turns out he was running a pretty high fever of 102.9°F. He&amp;#8217;s sick! Gave him some Ibuprofen to help him out. Wound up spending the night with him on the couch. Lesa HAD to be at work since all the students returned today so I was the lucky person to stay home with him. We watched movies and cat-napped.</description>

      <description>Church, Family Sunday, combined Sunday School, Dillan still at Gabe&amp;#8217;s and didn&amp;#8217;t go to church with us. Kids played, and we had Dillan home by two. Went to Walmart and let the kids get some toys or in Ashley&amp;#8217;s case some toys and crafts, with their Christmas money and gift cards. Thirty dollars each and they enjoyed even if we didn&amp;#8217;t so much. Got home and kids played rest of the afternoon, Bruce was exercising his imagination some which was refreshing.</description>

Ashley played. Lesa worked. I tried to sleep. Lesa fixed up Ashley&amp;#8217;s Girl Scout vest. I took Dillan to Dunham&amp;#8217;s Sports and bought him basketball shoes, shorts, pants and jacket, protector, and a basketball (to be shared), he starts basketball practice with Courts for Christ next week.</description>

      <description>Work and daycare. Dropped kids off and headed to work. Lesa and I texted back-and-forth on how to handle Ashley&amp;#8217;s Cookie Rally at Stalker. Ended up Lesa went grocery shopping and she picked up a couple of pizzas from Springville Store while I picked up the kids from daycare, I needed to get gas so did that first. Jessica said she had issues with Bruce but the other kids did okay.</description>

      <description>Lesa worked, daycare closed, I took the day off. Ashley woke me up and said she heard my phone beeping and her stomach hurt from being so hungry. Yeah, drama in the morning. Anyway, my phone had several texts from Lesa, her window was down and wouldn&amp;#8217;t roll up and she had about $600 worth of parking permits plus she kind of needed her Jeep. So I pulled the window motor from the spare Jeep, got the kids fed and dressed, and headed to her work.</description>

      <description>Kids woke us up, I sent them to their rooms and told them to be quiet. Went back to bed and to sleep. Lesa got up and kept things quiet. I slept until 10am! Longest in almost 6 years unless sick. It was awesome. Lesa made me coffee which was nice. I played Battleship with Ashley, then Dwyane. Took Dwyane to Mrs Dillman&amp;#8217;s house, her grandson Jay invited Dwyane to spend the night and go to Urban Air with them, it&amp;#8217;s his first sleepover, I think he&amp;#8217;s ready and will be okay.</description>

      <description>New Year&amp;#8217;s Eve. Worked, both of us. Lesa got off early and got the place cleaned up. I worked a full day and picked up kids. Got home and we all went into overdrive cleaning and picking up, well maybe not Bruce. Ken and Cassie Tussey, Emma and Woodrow came over to eat pizza, and they brought venison sausage with them! We played several games of euchre while kids played and ultimately watched TV.</description>

      <description>New Year&amp;#8217;s Eve Eve. Work and daycare, both sucked. Picked kids up and got an earful about the kids&amp;#8217; behavior. Dillan and Ashley fighting over a chair, Ashley scratched and drew blood, Dillan pinched and caused a welt, both told to sit and Dillan went off about how he hates it at daycare and started kicking a chair around. Bruce mouthed off at Annetta and got a timeout for that. Ashley and Dwyane fighting over a pillow, Dwyane throwing it in the bathroom and Ashley hitting him for doing it, multiple times, each trying to outdo the other.</description>

      <description>Skipped church, slept in, Lesa and kids tired, me too I guess. I never even got dressed. Boys did so they could play outside. I flew my drone. Ashley made necklaces and bracelets and Lesa and I helped her get sewing machine working. Lesa wrestled with Bruce and he had lots of fun. Kids did their best to clean out my truck but didn&amp;#8217;t do a very good job, mostly fought among themselves.</description>

      <description>Easy morning, got woke by kids, but not too early. Kids played with toys but Lesa had to put them outside, they were just too rowdy. She packed some sandwiches and at noon we headed to Sarah and Kaleigh&amp;#8217;s for the Williams Christmas. Two hours later we arrived, right on time. Becky and Maelee and boys already there, my parents and brother came shortly after. Kids had a great time, we had a good time too.</description>

      <description>Took kids to daycare, had to yell at them to get them ready, not the usual yelling but really yell, they just don&amp;#8217;t want to do anything but play. Sorry to say this but I was kind of relieved to be at work. Lesa worked too but she got off early and went to CVS and grocery shopping before heading home. I left on time and picked up the kids. They rode bikes until dark and we watched MIB International while eating pizza.</description>

Helped Ashley with her bracelet braider, helped Bruce with his puzzle, Dillan did fine with his car, and finally got to fly my drone. Dillan went to Gabe&amp;#8217;s for awhile, boys got their tablets, Ashley got my phone and her tablet, Dwyane danced and Bruce joined in. It was a pretty awesome day except for the kids fighting and bickering and complaining.</description>

Got up, Santa had visited, stockings were full too. Let the kids play all morning. Left for Indy and the Dellinger Christmas at noon, stopped at McDonald&amp;#8217;s on way, kids played with their cousins and had such fun. I haven&amp;#8217;t had much contact with my birth mom&amp;#8217;s side over the years but I&amp;#8217;m glad they accept the kids the way they do.</description>

      <description>Kids on break, we both took off, kids up way too early, excited as all get out. Lesa went to Dollar General and Walmart to get last minute stuff for Christmas. When she returned it was my turn. Asked kids if they wanted to go and Ashley and Dwyane said yes, I made Dillan and Bruce go anyway. I was trying to allow Lesa some time to herself. We went to Bed, Bath and Beyond and Kay Jewelers.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Christmas Eve Eve. Kids on Christmas Break, both Lesa and I had to work, I dropped boys off at daycare and Ashley went to work with me to play with Addie, my bosses daughter. There&amp;#8217;s a 5-year age gap there and Ashley got bored pretty quickly but she did good and made sure she was a friend to Addie. At noon I was hoping to leave, not able to, so stopped at Taco Bell and drove Ashley to daycare then came back to work.</description>

      <description>Family Church, Christmas Sunday, no evening service, short service and out earlier than usual. Kids have absolutely lost their minds. It was a beautiful afternoon and the kids insisted on tearing the house up, running, around like crazy, but when we asked them to go outside they said no. Then they started picking and fighting with each other, started to actually try and hurt each other, and had to try and put a stop to that.</description>

      <description>Sort of slept in, here the pitter-patter of feet, Lesa already up, figured she&amp;#8217;d be frustrated already so I got up. Lesa made me coffee, Ashley and Bruce snuggled with me. Lazy morning for me. After lunch, I hauled trash with Ashley and Bruce, Lesa and Dillan helped load. From trash we went to Lowe&amp;#8217;s and got a new garbage disposal and some cabinet rails rear mounts. Then I bought them Frosties.</description>

      <description>School, daycare, work. Lesa had a long rough day of moving and network being out &amp;#8211; per usual. I had an okay workday but couldn&amp;#8217;t wait to get out of there. Kids had a fun day of partying at school, Polar Express day where they wore their pajamas and watched the movie, a scavenger hunt, and other festivities to kick off Christmas Break. I left work at 3:30pm and went to get kids, picked up a card Daniel sent to our PO Box, picked up Papa John&amp;#8217;s pizza, and filled my tank.</description>

      <description>Lesa and I both worked full days. The kids went to school, they kids had their Christmas parties and gift exchanges and the excitement was high all day, by all accounts they had a great time. Mrs Malone and Mrs Willis blew up our phones with text messages and photos. More sledding, boys also played in the woods, none of them had gloves on! Their hands were red and will probably be chapped.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school, Lesa had off, I worked a normal day. Lesa got 50-some gifts wrapped and under the tree and she was also able to get to CVS for Dillan and Dwyane&amp;#8217;s medicine. Kids were super-excited when they got home. Bruce is the most excited and wants to open gifts now, hope he&amp;#8217;s not disappointed in what he gets for Christmas. Boys sledded before supper, Ashley read almost two hours.</description>

      <description>Call at 5:50am saying NLCS on a 2-hr delay. Call at 7:40am saying NLCS now closed. Lesa at work. I took kids to daycare and went to work too. Lesa picked up Dillan and Dwyane from daycare and took them to the doctor. They both had ear aches and Dillan had excess ear wax built up that the doctor removed. Lesa went to CVS and they didn&amp;#8217;t have scripts ready so she got some groceries and went back, still not ready!</description>

      <description>No closing, no two hour delay, just school per usual, roads wet but fine, kids were really disappointed. Kids wore Christmas sweaters today. Worked late. Picked up kids last minute, rushed home, ate dinner, and kids changed into pajamas for the Springville Elementary Christmas Sing-A-Long. Off we went, the boys classes were first, followed by the older kids. They all did good and sang. It was short but enjoyable. Got home early enough to watch TV, they watched The Santa Claus 2.</description>

      <description>Up until 4am doing the meditation, didn&amp;#8217;t fall asleep until an hour later, woke up when Lesa got up at 6a, then got woke up by kids at 7:30a. Gave the communion meditation, got a lot of positive feedback. Delivered communion to a home bound lady that made an impression on Ashley because Ashley prayed for her at lunch. Dillan went down to Gabe&amp;#8217;s, Lesa went to Walmart and Rural King, Ashley and Dwyane played in her room, Bruce played on Wii Console, and I actually got to nap.</description>

      <description>Tried to sleep in, honest. Was awakened by Ashley and Bruce standing next to my side of the bed, in the dark, and they said: It&amp;#8217;s an emergency. Dwyane is bleeding from his eye. And I was awake just like that. So, they were chasing each other, and Dwyane tripped over some pillows, and hit his eye on Bruce&amp;#8217;s toy box. Goose egg on the forehead above his eyebrow, and a ¼&amp;#8221; cut on his eye lid.</description>

      <description>School, work, daycare. Worked later, picked up kids later, stopped by bank on the way. Lesa grocery shopped. Ate pizza and went to Santa House, arrived at 6pm, got Sleigh 14 at 8:45pm, so we waited at the old bath house, watched A Charlie Brown Christmas followed by Polar Express 3D version. That put us at 8:30pm, everyone took a bathroom break, then off to Santa and Mrs Claus&amp;#8217; house. Ashley, Dwyane, and Bruce told Santa what they wanted.</description>

      <description>Work and school, had a frustrating day, glad it&amp;#8217;s over. Since we were going to Walmart, I thought it might save time if I just picked Lesa up, then the kids, then get a bite to eat, then Walmart. Asian Pearl, everyone got stuff they liked, it was a hit with the kids. Went to Walmart after, spent $355 dollars on a coat, new jammies for all the kids, and gift cards for Christmas.</description>

      <description>Dropped kids at school, headed to SAIC to pick up a couple of SSD drives for video archiving. Went to Bloomington and worked there until 3pm and then headed back to SAIC for another drive for maps. Have to get some Afghanistan maps delivered tomorrow or Friday. Met Lesa at TK Constructions model home in Bedford and did a walk-through &amp;#8211; without kids &amp;#8211; and liked what we saw. I picked up kids from daycare afterward and Lesa went home and started supper.</description>

      <description>School, daycare, work, same old, same old. Home game against Dollens Elementary, it&amp;#8217;s the last game of the season, the girls lost and the boys won. Ashley said there are playoff games on January 7th at BNL but nothing official yet. Ashley said she felt sick when I got there but I told her it was the last game and she should stick it out so she did. Dwyane got to wear the hornet mascot suit again, he had a good time.</description>

      <description>School, daycare, and work. Worked until last minute, went to the bank, barely made it to daycare in time to pick up the kids. Rained all day but temperatures were decent. Scout pack meeting tonight and I signed up for grapes, Lesa stopped by the store on her way home to get some. Supper was ready when kids and me got home, we ate, and headed to the pack meeting. Dwyane had snacks and Bruce was color guard; lots of awards, mostly popcorn related; last meeting of the year.</description>

      <description>Church, deacon in back. After lunch Lesa ran Christmas at the Zoo money to Amanda. I felt sick so tried to nap but butt hole neighbor was shooting. Dillan went down to Gabe&amp;#8217;s and Ashley went to Kaleena&amp;#8217;s. Boys played inside/outside. I put new straw and some Timothy hay in the rabbit hutch for Ashley. Kids got home at 5:00p and I turned on Indiana Jones, then they watched another right after.</description>

      <description>Slept until 8am, surprised at that. Stopped by PO Box and picked up another letter from Daniel om my way to take the kids to get hair cuts at Fantastic Sams. The boys wanted their hair cut short so we did the #4 on top and #2 on side summer cut. Ashley wanted bangs, stylist checked and said it wouldn&amp;#8217;t work very well, so she got her ends trimmed as originally planned.</description>

      <description>School, daycare, work. Ashley sat in RTI room, not sure what that is. Missed lunch with the teacher. She earned the honor but had to forfeit it due to her bad behavior the other day. Kids were talking about her all day and that bothered her &amp;#8211; I say good. Picked up the kids from daycare, went home and we waited for Lesa to get home from work and grocery shopping, helped her carry in and put up, then we all went to the Scientia Christmas party.</description>

      <description>Work and school. Had a map meeting at 11:00am to discuss maps and map resources and didn&amp;#8217;t get out until 2:00pm! Lesa went to the dentist, got a clean and polish, no cavities. I got a text from Mrs Davis saying Ashley was in trouble and would have to sit out a game tonight, and that Mr Hudson would be calling me about it. Saw where I had a missed Springville call and called him back, he was in a meeting and would get back to me.</description>

      <description>School and work. Picked up kids from daycare. Only thing planned was Wheeler Mission presentation at Cincinnati Christian Church and I opted not to go. The kids are so tired as are we. Ashley had a total meltdown after getting sent to bed early for talking back to me. Everyone hates her and she hates her life. Zaida at school is being mean, Lesa and me don&amp;#8217;t love her and are being mean, and she wants to see her Grandpa David and Cousin Eve.</description>

      <description>Ashley had a nightmare, crawled into bed between us, I tucked her back into her bed. Work and school again. Left in time to take Ashley to an away game at Stalker. All the boys went to daycare and Lesa picked them up from there. I was really worried Lesa would be stressed when when got home but she didn&amp;#8217;t seem to be. Looked like the boys played the Wii. By the time Ashley and I got home everyone else had already eaten supper so we ate together by ourselves.</description>

      <description>Back to work and school. We suffered today. I picked up the mail from the PO Box, another letter from Daniel. Same old, same old. How he&amp;#8217;s sorry, how he loves the kids so much, how he wishes the kids would forgive him and write back. He pretends he cares about the kids, pretends to be sorry, but in reality his letters are all about him. We see typical addict behavior and mentality and we suspect the sudden burst of letters has to do with a program of some sort and he&amp;#8217;s hoping to gain an early release or something.</description>

Chilled as in Lesa and I didn&amp;#8217;t go anywhere or do much work. Lesa always works so that doesn&amp;#8217;t count. She did play a board game with the kids though, except Dillan who went to Gabe&amp;#8217;s. Kaleena was going to come down but not sure what happened there.</description>

      <description>Williams Thanksgiving today. Nasty rainy day all day. Lesa had a lot of cooking going on so I took the kids to Starbucks to get hot chocolate and mostly to get then out of her hair. Then we went to Walmart and got a couple of items Lesa needed like dinner rolls and celery. Skipped the donuts even though it was tempting. First to show was Sarah and Kaleigh followed by Becky and kids.</description>

Ashley busy cleaning her room and making it safe for Maelee. Boys have a mess absolutely everywhere. Spent part of the day cleaning up the house, yard and deck. After lunch Lesa went grocery shopping and kids got tablets for the chores they did. Lesa got home with the ingredients we needed to make deserts for tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Slept in, sort of. Had to get up to go to Avery and Emily&amp;#8217;s for Thanksgiving. Kids super excited to see their cousins and played with them all day. Lesa and I hung with family and everyone had a good dinner. Hate the drive to Indy now-a-days but we made good time coming and going. The kids rode bikes when we got home, it was near dark but we let them burn off the energy anyway.</description>

      <description>Let the kids sleep an extra hour since no school. Took them to daycare. Lesa stayed home and cleaned house. I went to work, wasn&amp;#8217;t too late. Power flickered on and off at work and finally stayed off, estimate to fix was 11pm. Most everyone went home, me included. Lesa didn&amp;#8217;t want me to pick up kids yet so I didn&amp;#8217;t. Home and hour and power out here too. Outage map said estimate on getting service restored 1:20am so I got the generator going, hooked up the TV and a light, and while I was getting a space heater the electricity came back on!</description>

      <description>Lesa tossed and turned and coughed all night long and kept us both up. She&amp;#8217;s sick. Hope I don&amp;#8217;t get sick! Got up, got kids ready, took them to school. They acted like they were on vacation already and didn&amp;#8217;t want to get ready. Dillan spent 20 minutes in the shower that was supposed to be a rinse-off shower. Anyway, got them to school. Put Ashley&amp;#8217;s cheerleader bow in her hair in the school parking lot.</description>

      <description>Lesa on vacation all week, cleaning and prepping for Thanksgiving. I get to work. Kids had school so I got them up and ready and dropped them off. Ashley and Dwyane had a home game against Lincoln and I left work a few minutes early to go. Girls lost but the boys game was the best elementary school game ever. The crowd thought so too. Very exciting and a lot of fun.</description>

      <description>Was going to skip church and go deer hunting but Lesa would have had a rough time getting kids ready and there so I went with. Filled in as front deacon. I was messing around with Dillan during the sermon &amp;#8211; again, and Lesa got mad at us &amp;#8211; again. Dillan was missing homework again, got it online, and made him do it, he had a fit. Afterward he finished he went to Gabe&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>Went out deer hunting this morning, rained the entire time. Didn&amp;#8217;t see a thing but I heard some turkeys. Was supposed to pick up Bruce from Corbin&amp;#8217;s house around noon, then one or two, then they went to Bloomington, and I finally picked him up about three-thirty. They played X-Box, went to Captain D&amp;#8217;s for dinner, had meatloaf sandwiches for breakfast and toasted PBJs for lunch, stayed up late and slept in late.</description>

      <description>Friday! School, daycare, work. Left early, picked up kids, got a couple hours hunting in. Bruce rode the bus home with Corbin, Grady rides the same bus, because Bruce is spending the night at Corbin&amp;#8217;s. He&amp;#8217;s been excited all week and apparently he&amp;#8217;s a big kid now &amp;#8211; at least he&amp;#8217;s been acting like it. Emma was supposed to spend the night, came over awhile and did crafts with Ashley, they made a huge mess of the glitter.</description>

      <description>School and work, school and work. Left early, picked up Ashley as a car-rider, daycare got the boys. Took Ashley to St. Vincent to cheer for the basketball games, we were early so hung out in the gym until things picked up. Meanwhile, Lesa picked up the boys. Girls team won their game 23 to 19. We left early because Ashley said she had a headache and wanted to go. When we left the boys were losing by 8 or 10 points.</description>

      <description>Kids school, Lesa and me went to work. Dropped off Girl Scout destined for daycare before work. Got another letter from Daniel dated November 12 and scanned and added it to site. Picked up kids from daycare. Talked to Annetta and Jessica for quite awhile about school closings. Ashley told them we&amp;#8217;re going to go to a different school so naturally they were wondering about our kids. Dillan told me I was a good dad, better than his birth dad, because I love and take care of him.</description>

      <description>School and work, rained all day, slow-ish day for me, not sure about Lesa. Left at 4:30 and got the kids on the late side but I don&amp;#8217;t think they noticed &amp;#8211; they were watching TV. Got home and no place to go! Checked rabbits with Ashley, boys played, a little bit of homework with Lesa, Ashley read for an hour and then Maelee-proofed her room for Thanksgiving. Boys took baths, Dillan a shower.</description>

      <description>School and work. Kids already excited for Thanksgiving, they thought they got off this week. Gave myself a haircut. Went to SAIC and worked the afternoon. Got to daycare earlier than usual, took the kids to Dollar General and restocked the truck candy supply. Ate supper, boys didn&amp;#8217;t want to go to Cub Scouts, made them anyway, they had a lot of fun, and announced on the way home they loved Scouts and want to keep going.</description>

      <description>Took kids to church, Lesa stayed home, passed out a lot of Girl Scout candy orders, worked in Junior Church, got Bruce to do motions with me but not Dwyane. Ashley is a leader at church and very smart with the lessons. Ashley&amp;#8217;s Girl Scout trip to WonderLab didn&amp;#8217;t materialize, leaders sort of nixed it as too much activity for one weekend. Dillan got home about 1:30pm. We all went to Rural King and got straw for the rabbits bedding and some chicken feed.</description>

      <description>Up before everyone, opening day deer season, out before light, then in at 11a, and out again at 3p until dark. Didn&amp;#8217;t see a thing other than squirrels! Ashley had a Girl Scout ecology event in Hoosier National Forest on opening day of all day! That scares me to death! She climbed the fire tower. That scares me to death too! She came back to us by the grace of God.</description>

      <description>Work and school. I had to go to SAIC to deliver the latest and greatest OS and hoped to be there by 4p but that wasn&amp;#8217;t going to happen so I figured early Monday morning. Stopped and picked up the kids. Went ahead and drove to SAIC and was able to get a pass in, had to sign to get all the kids in, and made my delivery. Kids thought it was awesome cool to see all the military gear and equipment.</description>

      <description>Lesa working from home today, she has a 1:00 dentist appointment and Dillan and Ashley have eye exams. I worked at Scientia. Got off and I went straight to the Bedford North Lawrence (BNL) Professional Arts Center (PAC). I was number 37 to speak and had a minute to do so. Stood in front of 500+ people plus live stream audience and said my say on keeping Springville Elementary open. Not my usual evening activity.</description>

      <description>School open, took kids. Went to work myself. Lesa worked as well. Non-eventful work and school day. Lesa picked up Ashley after her cheerleading practice. I picked up the boys. Slow evening but got an email from Jerry Hill concerning the school closings, particularly Springville Elementary. Called him and he wants me to speak at the public input session tomorrow night at the BNL PAC center. He also told Lesa a couple of weeks ago I should run for school board.</description>

      <description>School canceled. Lesa went in an hour late. I stayed home and kept the kids with me, didn&amp;#8217;t have it in me to drop them off at daycare. Ashley mostly watched TV and played with a doll, the boys played outside in the snow. Bruce came in and cried because his feet got too cold, got him warmed up, and put my heavy wool socks on him. Hot chocolate and some vegetable soup got them all warmed up again.</description>

      <description>Veteran&amp;#8217;s Day, I have off! Got up early though to take kids to school. Lesa went to work. Went to Johnson&amp;#8217;s house, helped Ross move roll-top desk, loaded mower and cart and brought home. Went back for treadmill and opted not, helped him load in his truck. They gave us a 42&amp;#8243; plasma TV and a chest freezer. Went to kids&amp;#8217; Veteran&amp;#8217;s Day Program, I&amp;#8217;m proud of them and our school.</description>

      <description>Church, Deacon in Back and Lobby Security. Afterward, we hooked up trailer and loaded bikes, got gas, and went to Paul and Andrea&amp;#8217;s for lunch with the Johnsons. Beautiful day for cookout. Kids rode bikes and had an awesome time and didn&amp;#8217;t want to leave. Got home and kids still rambunctious and played outside. Kaleena came over and ate with us. I got into a fight with Lesa and left for a couple of hours, had to decide whether I wanted to come back or not, came back for the kids&amp;#8217; sake.</description>

      <description>Slept in! Got up before boys, quiet without Dillan and Ashley, or should I say quieter. Got the boys breakfast, they were playing with Dillan&amp;#8217;s stuff. Took boys with me to Tieman&amp;#8217;s in Owensburg to get tires for Lesa&amp;#8217;s Jeep, Bruce did nothing but complain. He survived and made it home alive. Ate lunch and then started getting trash together. Hauled trash, made the boys go with me, again they both survived relatively unscathed.</description>

Gave them money for meals and souvenirs, drove all the kids to school and went in with them to add Ken to the sign out list. Got a couple dozen donuts for the shop and went to work. Ken picked the kids up early from school and they headed to New Albany/Louisville with the rest of the middle school youth group.</description>

Ashley had Girl Scouts so I dropped her off at 6pm. Went back at 7pm for awards and talked to Alisha a lot about the school closings &amp;#8211; or should say she talked to me a lot.</description>

Let him know he&amp;#8217;d better get them home tonight, or he gets a whopping and SuperStart will go away. Took kids to school and went to work. Made Ashley an appointment with dermatologist for February, referral from the doctor after the last rash she had. Dillan had his missing papers when I picked the kids up from daycare.</description>

Finished the day out there and then picked up Dillan and Bruce from daycare. Home game against Parkview, Ashley was cheerleading, Dwyane was in Hornets Nest. Mrs Davis texted Ashley forgot her bow so went home and looked but didn&amp;#8217;t see it so went to game.</description>

      <description>Family Sunday, Lockup Deacon. Ashley had a Girl Scout meeting of all things and it got canceled due to a death in Alisha Goodwine&amp;#8217;s family. The kids were constantly fighting so I made them go outside to play. Ashley wanted to process the persimmons we have so I showed her how, we were able to get 8 cups of pulp. Kids finely started playing well with each other. Ate supper and took Dillan and Ashley to youth group.</description>

      <description>Didn&amp;#8217;t get to sleep in even though I really wanted too. Instead we all went to C3 and helped with Hope Harvest 2019. Signed all the kids up this year, they were a pain-in-the-butt but did pretty good for being kids. Three hours was about the limit though and thankfully we were done in that amount of time. Packed some 70,000 meals. I needed some sleep so Lesa took the boys to Lowe&amp;#8217;s and bought a couple of leaf rakes to give me a chance to take a nap.</description>

      <description>Have to go to Atterbury again, hadn&amp;#8217;t planned on that, but didn&amp;#8217;t need to be there by 7a so I got to take the kids to school and drop them off. Nice morning but cold, leaves look awesome. Did some testing and SAIC guys starting breaking down equipment and basically we were chased out. By 3:30 I was off work! Picked up the kids and headed home. Lesa took PTO and went grocery shopping and installed the heated water bottle for the rabbits.</description>

      <description>Halloween! It snowed! It was demo day at Atterbury, got there at 6:50am, was the first person to arrive, others started arriving around 7am. Lesa took kids to daycare and picked them up. Long day of work, very stressful but all went well. I got home about 6 and we got kids ready and took them to Cornerstone Church for their Fall Carnival. Kids got lots of candy and played a bunch of games and had their faces painted and knew lots of other kids so they had a really good time.</description>

      <description>Up early to go to Camp Atterbury. Lesa got kids fed and to daycare. It rained all day and temps dropped. Had hard time in the curves and couldn&amp;#8217;t see squat. Everything is set up and ready for tomorrow so I got to leave just before lunch. So I called Lesa and asked if she wanted to go to Taste of India with me and absolutely, so I picked her up, and I pretty much talked shop the entire time, and then dropped her back off.</description>

      <description>Another day at Camp Atterbury, two down, two to go. Left Atterbury early and headed to Scientia and tested a new build and actually got home before dark! Text from Mrs Davis: Dillan filled his test paper with emojis and turned it in. Then he typed random gobbledygook on a second paper; F&amp;#8217;s of course. I told him since he doesn&amp;#8217;t want to do school work I was going to make him do real work and he seemed okay with that, so I had him dig a hole in the woods for an hour &amp;#8211; he didn&amp;#8217;t make the hour.</description>

      <description>Up at 5a, left at 5:30a for Atterbury. Left at 5:30p and home by 7p! Long day! Lesa dropped kids at daycare, daycare took them to school. Ashley stayed after for cheer practice, Lesa picked her up, then the boys. She took them all to Cub Scout Pack meeting. They got home at 7:15p. Ashley ran in crying Lesa said she&amp;#8217;d rather die than spend another minute in the car with them.</description>

      <description>Church, paid for Dillan and Ashley to go to SuperStart. Lesa got mad at Dillan and me for horsing in the pews during the sermon. Ross and Bobbi Johnson&amp;#8217;s last day, most likely won&amp;#8217;t see them again. They gave kids some Matchbox toy cars. We took them and the Fries out to lunch at El Ranchero Mexican Restaurant in Bloomington, we all had a nice time &amp;#8211; even the kids. Always hard to lose good friends and decent people.</description>

      <description>Rained pretty heavy all night and most of the day. Got up at 8a, took Dillan to guitar lesson and picked up Ashley. During lesson, Cassie, Emma, Woodrow, Ashley and myself went to Emma Miracle&amp;#8217;s to see the baby goats. Came home and Ashley very tired but won&amp;#8217;t nap. Ate lunch. Went to Rural King, got some stuff for the rabbits and chickens. Went to Walmart and got Ashley a pair of dress shoes and a pair of dress boots, got Dillan a new pair of mud boots, and Dwyane a pair of dress shoes as well.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school, Ashley going home with Cassie and Emma Tussey tonight after school, so checked her overnight bag and wrote a note so Cassie could get her. Dillan and the boys went to daycare. I wound up at Atterbury all day and didn&amp;#8217;t get home until after six. Lesa went grocery shopping, then picked up the boys. She dropped Dillan off at church for C3 Nerf Wars, Dillan was pissed because Ken used a paint gun and it hurt.</description>

      <description>Dropped kids off at school. Went to Scientia, expected to go to Atterbury today but stayed to help a co-worker. Worker until 4:30p and then left to get kids from daycare. They had a little time to play before eating and after dinner played some more. The kids had some homework, Bruce sight words, Dwyane reading, Ashley reading, and Dillan spelling. Ashley got all her stuff ready for spending the night at Emma&amp;#8217;s tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school again. Worked at Scientia, then drove to Camp Atterbury and worked there until late afternoon so Lesa had to pick up the kids. She picked up Ashley from cheerleading practice and then picked up the boys from daycare. They had already eaten supper by the time I got home. The boys rode their bikes through mud puddles and had mud in their hair and elsewhere so they had to take showers for the second time in as many nights.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school. Dropped truck off at Sturgis and had left front wheel bearing replaced. Worked at Scientia until 2p, luckily I wasn&amp;#8217;t need out at Camp Atterbury so I got to pick Ashley up from school. The boys rode the van to daycare per usual. I took Ashley to her first real cheerleading event for Springville Elementary at an away game. The girl and boy Basketball teams played Heltonville.</description>

      <description>Drove kids to school, drove to work. Drove the 4Runner, clutch pedal going to floor and not returning which kind of puts a damper on driving. Thought I&amp;#8217;d have to go to Camp Atterbury and possibly spend the night but no. Worked over a half hour and then picked up the kids from daycare. Rained all day so basically just stayed in and watched TV. Ashley&amp;#8217;s top to her uniform finally arrived and she was excited to show it off to us with a cheer.</description>

      <description>Cincinnati Christian Church 100th Anniversary and they had a lunch and celebration, drew a huge crowd, all the deacons showed up at 9 and parked at library across the street. Ashley and Dillan came in early with me. Stayed for lunch and while kids played nine square outside we listened to some of the older folks stories about the church. It was kind of nice. Came home, kids played outside. Kaleena called, Ashley went to her house and the two of them showed up later at our house.</description>

      <description>Got up early, Ashley and me went to the Tussey&amp;#8217;s along with Nicole Rogers. We slaughtered and butchered 30 chickens. Ashley and Emma helped. Emma got kicked by their donkey but is okay. Ashley did all stations except butchering and killing. Came home with a cooler full of meat birds. Dillan was riding dirt bike when we got home and the boys were riding bicycles. After showers Ashley joined the boys and I took a nap, Lesa went and got 20 pounds of ice to put on the birds.</description>

      <description>Work, daycare, Lesa stayed home. Lesa went grocery shopping, Walmart, Rural King, got chicken stuff and kids some clothes. I went to Atterbury, kind of a busy day. Found out I&amp;#8217;ll probably be doing an all-nighter on this upcoming Tuesday. I&amp;#8217;ll be there most of next week and the following. Sucks for everyone especially Lesa who will need to handle the kids. She picked them up tonight. I got home late as expected.</description>

      <description>Back to work for me, Lesa stayed home, kids went to daycare. Long, long day for everyone I think. Bruce aggravated Dillan at daycare, Dillan kicked Bruce and hurt him. Annetta called and said Bruce wasn&amp;#8217;t behaving his normal self, wouldn&amp;#8217;t eat, and just sat holding his side. He said it hurt really bad so she called me. She didn&amp;#8217;t think I needed to leave work early so I didn&amp;#8217;t. Lesa came up and we returned the rental.</description>

      <description>Got up early, got the kids breakfast, got packed and loaded, and left for home. Rained entire way in Tennessee and the wind was very strong in spots. Could tell it rained in Kentucky as well, but the wind lessened and made first stop just short of Lexington! Ate at Wendy&amp;#8217;s, service sucked. Plugged in Batman LEGO Movie. Ran 80-85 mph the entire time I was on an interstate and it really trimmed down our travel time.</description>

      <description>Got up earlier, Ashley&amp;#8217;s ankle doing better. Went into Pigeon Forge to tour the Titanic Museum. I was worried the kids might get bored but they seemed to enjoy it. I was soured from the start when they made us wait an hour past our reserved time to let a travel club go in front of us. We were given identities that resembled our gender and age. All the kids and Lesa survived, I was killed.</description>

      <description>Lazy morning probably cost us a chance at seeing black bears at Cades Cove and definitely left us in traffic on the Loop, however, the views were beautiful, we got to stop halfway around and have lunch at the most beautiful spot in the entire park. It was totally awesome. We stopped at man of the churches and cabins along the way. Ashley sprained her ankle on the steps horsing around with the boys so she slowed things up and limited some of what we could do, started hurting her really bad later in the day and each stop made it stiffen even more.</description>

      <description>Lesa woke up to Dillan. I woke up to Lesa, the rest of the kids woke up to me. Ashley&amp;#8217;s rash is back &amp;#8211; on her back this time. Spent the day in the Smokey Mountain National Park. Started off at the Townsend entrance sign, then some little overlook with a small waterfall in the background. The Sinks were next, it&amp;#8217;s kind of a shame the kids couldn&amp;#8217;t explore on the rocks and stuff like Lesa and I did the last time we were here but it was also kind of a relief.</description>

      <description>Finished packing and loading the truck. Headed for the Smokies. Sonja is pet sitting. Took us 7 hours to get here. Had a decent trip. Kids are driving us crazy and I swore I was going to whip all of them &amp;#8211; multiple times &amp;#8211; but never did. Got to our place in Townsend, I thought it was a cabin but it was a house instead, really nice place and I have no complaints.</description>

Should have gotten off at 11:00am because of the time I put in at Atterbury on Wednesday but wound up working until 3:30pm giving me some more comp time. Met Lesa and we went to Budget to get our rental car, a Tahoe SUV. I picked up kids and Lesa fixed supper. Spent the evening getting prepped for tomorrow. Kids are very excited.</description>

      <description>Kids glad I got them ready for school this morning, they love Lesa but yesterday was a departure from their normal routine. Dropped them off at school and headed to work. Thought I&amp;#8217;d be heading back to Atterbury but not, probably tomorrow. It&amp;#8217;s Thursday, which is $5 sushi day at Fresh Tyme, so I got some sushi for lunch. Left at 3:30p and made it just in time for Parent-Teacher Conferences.</description>

Ashley didn&amp;#8217;t have cheerleading practice today, scheduled off last week. Lesa picked up the kids from daycare as well. I was at Camp Atterbury until 5:30pm and didn&amp;#8217;t get home until 7:00pm. Everyone glad to see me and I&amp;#8217;m glad to be home, Lesa stopped by CVS before picking up kids to get medicine for pin worms and gave each kid their dose.</description>

      <description>Dropped kids off at school, left off on time, and picked up kids. Lesa went grocery shopping after work so we beat her home. Kids played outside together and actually got along with each other. They are getting excited about going to the Smokies. Lesa took Girl Scout sales money to Amanda after we got the amount due calculated, I watched the kids and got them all in the shower. Ashley said she had a question, and told me that when she wiped she saw something crawling and she wanted me to look, so I did, and sure enough she had little white worms in her anus, took a sample with tweezers and looked them up, they are called thread or pin worms and can be treated with over-the-counter medicine.</description>

Ashley went on a field trip to West Gate and Odon Park, they had a good time, Ashley brought home a solar oven she made. Took the boys to Cub Scouts, a Bedford police officer spoke with Wolves, Dwyane group. He turned on lights but not the siren.</description>

      <description>Stayed home from church, everyone utterly exhausted, especially Lesa. Leisurely morning. I picked up Ashley at 12:30p and she was ready to come home. They got wet, no fly on the tent, and when it began raining they just threw the fly on top but the girls had a good time. I took Dillan to his guitar lesson at 2p, Ken revealed to Dillan the top 4, or was it 5, secrets of being a guitar player.</description>

      <description>Lesa and I woke up to my 8:00am alarm. Lesa got up, I tried to snooze more but unable. Kids were still asleep! Dogs rushed into Ashley&amp;#8217;s room and nuzzled her and she woke up, the boys followed. Even our dogs love the kids! Got the Cub Scout boys ready for selling popcorn, had to get mad and light a fire under them to get them moving. Bruce was his usual grumpy self, complained about everything.</description>

      <description>Got Ashley to pack all her cheerleading stuff, took care of animals, and drove kids to school. Thought I was going to get off at noon since I worked last Sunday so I had asked Lesa to go on a date lunch but she couldn&amp;#8217;t go so a good thing since I would up having to work anyway, turned my overtime into comp time for upcoming holidays. Got put in charge of the map program at work.</description>

      <description>My birthday, 58, an old man and feel it too, text from my dad, kids woke up trying to give me notes and presents, had to ask them to wait until evening during my party. Drove them to school again, called Mr Hudson and talked to him myself, got a good understanding of what happened, just kids being kids and parents (Kensie&amp;#8217;s) over-reacting. Lesa sent me chocolates at work for my birthday!</description>

Dwyane took a field trip to Spring Mill and had a picnic there, took a hike, visited the Grissom Space Center and played on the playground, according to Dwyane he had a great day. Mr Hudson talked to Kensie and Ashley again! Left a message on the machine but I didn&amp;#8217;t get to hear it because Lesa accidentally erased it. Lesa picked up Ashley from cheer practice, then picked up the boys from daycare.</description>

Dillan had rash on his face now, all around his eyes, and he&amp;#8217;s been rubbing it, took a look and decided to call doctor for him too, Lesa was able to rearrange her work schedule to take him and then worked from home.</description>

      <description>Barely made bus, kids ran to get on, Axsoms started yelling at Ashley. Tried asking what was up but they drove off, I followed, wound up in the parking lot of the liquor store in Oolitic. Axsoms said Ashley shoved Kensie getting on bus, and Kensie said Ashley made her eat paper and has been bullying her. I didn&amp;#8217;t see the shoving thing but the bullying did happen last week, and so I told them I&amp;#8217;d take care of it.</description>

      <description>Ashley&amp;#8217;s rash all over her neck, called and made another appointment, suspect it may be biological &amp;#8211; like strep or something. Lesa too Dillan to guitar lesson while I toted remaining kids around. Got them a Frosty after the doctor&amp;#8217;s visit, then CVS for different meds and a topical cream. Lesa called no to persimmon festival. I spent the afternoon preparing the Greek salad and the souvlaki &amp;#8211; dinner was awesome,!</description>

      <description>Finally Friday, seemed like a very long week. Kids rode bus. Lesa went grocery shopping, got bulk of my Greek dinner items, I got remaining from Fresh Thyme before picking up the kids up from daycare. Lesa picked up pizza from Papa John&amp;#8217;s. Let the kids watch a movie &amp;#8211; even Dillan and Ashley. &amp;#8211; I ended their grounding early. Made Tzatziki and put in fridge, and made marinade and added chicken breasts and refrigerated as well.</description>

      <description>Ashley&amp;#8217;s last day taking Prednisone, how her behavior improves and she feels better. Dropped the kids off at school, spent way too much time getting ready and taking care of animals. Work stressful, sucks, not sure where I stand, not sure why they keep me around. Jerry Davis texted and me and kids met him and Michelle at Springville Store so I could pay him for bush hogging new property, chatted awhile, kids said they missed Michelle.</description>

Long work day, crashed a video encoder at end of the day, almost late picking up boys. Ashley had cheerleader practice, Lesa picked her up. Met the girls up on our new property along with Mike Pearson. We discussed land layout among other things.</description>

Got the rest of the kids up, fed, and ready for school. Lesa worked from home and Dillan went back to sleep. A couple hours later he was good to go. Her flowers got delivered but she wasn&amp;#8217;t there. Ashley brought his homework home for him and all the kids had homework of one kind or another.</description>

      <description>Ashley&amp;#8217;s face better already after just one round of Prednisone. Worked at SAIC all day. Ordered flowers via FTD for Lesa &amp;#8211; just because. Grounded Dillan and Ashley from TV for two and one week respectively for fighting with each other. Ashley antagonized Dillan by taking his seat at daycare and Dillan retaliated by hitting and kicking and hurting her. Dillan got two because he was just in the principal&amp;#8217;s office last Friday for pretty much the same thing.</description>

      <description>Ashley&amp;#8217;s face much worse. Church, Junior Church with Ashley, Dwyane and Bruce. Dillan was in sanctuary with Lesa. Ashley sold lots of candy. Got Ashley a doctor appointment right after church so got her there right away, Prednisone alike last time, but this time tablets, and 20mg at that, made her get super hyper and hungry. Picked up a new GS order form from Amanda. Ate lunch at Taco Bell. At home tried to nap, guess I fell asleep for awhile, woke up and heard neighbor riding ATV around our loop again, Dillan and Bruce rode bikes through his yard and messed up his stone border.</description>

Lesa canceled fishing for me after scheduling fishing for me. Anyway, Ashley woke up with allergic reaction on her face, called doctor, suggested Benadryl, didn&amp;#8217;t help like we knew it wouldn&amp;#8217;t. Got a plate for the 4Runner, chicken and rabbit feed, and took the kids to lunch at Steak &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; Shake.</description>

      <description>Friday, kids rode bus. Drove Suburban, miss is gone, fixed for $56, happy. Worked in Bloomington until 11:00, then drove disk to SAIC, tested and left for the day. Picked up Lesa, and we went to school for Grandparent&amp;#8217;s Day. As we walked in Mr Hudson intercepted us and pointed Dillan out sitting in the office, he hit Ashley in the back, and when he was told to stop, he got mad, threw a ball that hit a bucket that hit a girl in the mouth and busted her lip.</description>

Delivered disk to SAIC then worked in Bloomington for the remainder of the day &amp;#8211; felt wiped out all day long. Lesa drove Ashley to her Girl Scout meeting at Fayetteville Elementary. I tried to get a nap in after dinner but that didn&amp;#8217;t happen.</description>

      <description>Kids thought it was cool to ride in the 4Runner, they all like it. Bus, work, busy day, had 6 hours overtime last week, would have more this week except I&amp;#8217;m taking a half day on Friday. Work is a bear, got home and started working, worked past midnight, Ashley says I get bitchy when I have to work at home and she doesn&amp;#8217;t like it. Second night of math with Dillan.</description>

      <description>Kids caught bus per usual. Drove the Suburban, it was missing out from the moment I started it, actually worried about getting to work and back and worried about being stuck on side of the road with four kids too. Ashley remembered her GS Candy order form and made some sales at school. Dillan had a really bad grade on his math pretest so I made him rework the entire pretest.</description>

Truck stilling running bad on way to get kids and home. Took Dwyane and Bruce to Cub Scouts, Ashley did her reading homework, Dillan did multiplication flashcards. Started a daily Bible study with Ashley and Lesa and I kind of hope she sticks with it and maybe Dillan join too.</description>

      <description>Church, lead deacon in back, security also. After church went to work and picked up Toyota 4-Runner I bought off Todd Davidson. Lesa followed me in Suburban and kids rode with me, they were excited to ride in something new and were amazed at the stick shift. Ashley went to Kaleena&amp;#8217;s and Dillan to Gabe&amp;#8217;s. Gary Flynn&amp;#8217;s son and grandson were riding their motorcycles around our loop, Dillan called them butt holes, whole thing exploded into an argument but sort of smoothed over but not really resolved.</description>

Wound up making four pots for folks, and scrambling six dozen eggs. Dwyane ate nearly an entire bag of donuts, Bruce ate what he didn&amp;#8217;t. Broke camp after breakfast and took boys to Shoot-O-Ree. Their favorite things were fishing rod casting, Marshmallow shooters, and catapults.</description>

Got pizza from Papa John&amp;#8217;s. Smattering of rain in the afternoon but quickly stopped. Jordan sent a link to the finished PAVA photos.

Boys have been helping with chicks, Ashley so-so taking care of rabbits. Lesa rushed to have supper, I rushed to get kids, Ashley had her Girl Scout meeting and they&amp;#8217;re selling nuts and candies. Lesa bought some, and then she pestered me and when I didn&amp;#8217;t respond as quickly as she thought I should she started crying and accusing me of not loving her, half hour later she was better.</description>

      <description>School, work. Mr Hudson called, Bruce got into a fight with a kid on the playground, started out friendly roughhousing that turned into to rough, had to go to his office and again during recess for remainder of the week. Ashley had cheerleader practice, Lesa picked her up, she did a couple of cheers for us. Dillan brought home a 32% on his school work and I got made and lectured him about it.</description>

      <description>Normal morning. Worked late again. Picture retake forms came home with Ashley. Picked up kids at last minute. Got gas and went to Dollar General and restocked the candy supply. Lesa had supper ready by the time we got home. Kids rode bikes after dinner but that didn&amp;#8217;t last long. Helped Ashley clean out rabbit hutch, then I cleaned the fryers&amp;#8217; coop. All the kids were super hot and sweaty so showers were next.</description>

      <description>Normal morning, kids rode bus. Worked half a day in Bloomington and half the day in Bedford. Lesa took Ashley out of school early and took her to the dentist, spacer is okay but tooth is getting loose and will fall out soon. Kept really busy and worked until 4:30. Picked up kids around 5:00pm. After dinner I took boys to their Cub Scout meeting, they did announcements and meeting inside before heading outside to play.</description>

      <description>Serving deacon, Dillan and Ashley got Baptism Certificates and Bible Study books from Tonya Johnson and church, visited Nancy Huffman and Gladys Gilland. Ate lunch at Burger King. Dwyane needed new tires and tubes plus an entire wheel since the bearings are blown out so Lesa and I decided we&amp;#8217;d make it a Dad and Dwyane outing to Walmart. Inner tubes and wheel alone cost nearly as much as a new bike, plus they didn&amp;#8217;t have a wheel, so Dwyane got to pick out a new bike!</description>

      <description>Got up early and dressed for our 2019 PAVA photo shoot at Southeastway Park in Indy. Jordan took photos again per tradition. Shot in a different location than the rock this year, took the photos near the pond. The kids did pretty well and then started getting bored of course. Afterward, we had a picnic lunch and let the kids play on the playground. We noticed 456 South westbound lanes were closed so we had to drive through Wanamaker and Greenwood to get back to Highway 37 and home.</description>

      <description>Friday! Really rough day for me, stressed at work, entire side buzzed so bad it hurt, it still does. Lesa has most of the Fall Break trip planned, has an Airbnb, and a car rented &amp;#8211; a cabin in the Smokey&amp;#8217;s and a minivan. Midterms: Dillan As, Bs, Cs and 3 Ds, and an evaluation stating he&amp;#8217;s at performing at a 2nd grade level; Ashley As and 2 Bs; ditto for Dwyane and a pleasure to have note; and Bruce no grades but a positive note.</description>

      <description>Normal AM. Worked a long day again. Kids got their school photos. Bruce looks so stinking cute except for his face is all mangled from scrapes and cuts. Dwyane&amp;#8217;s tooth is crooked and in front of the others giving his this weird kind of smile. Ashley looks exactly like Nicolle, Lesa doesn&amp;#8217;t think so much. Dillan looks good and with a decent smile for once. At dinner all the kids tattled on everyone else&amp;#8217;s girlfriend/boyfriends &amp;#8211; none of them really have one &amp;#8211; just teasing each other.</description>

      <description>Same morning routine: Dwyane and Bruce big chickens, Ashley rabbits, and me the chicks. Bus on time. Started workday at SAIC and ended at Scientia. Another rough day, afternoon got better. Haven&amp;#8217;t had a headache in quite a while but have one now. Lesa texted to let me know highway already backed up, she barely made it in time to get Ashley from cheerleader practice, they learned the Wipeout &amp;#8211; whatever that is.</description>

Bruce and Dwyane took care of the big chickens, Ashley her rabbits, and me the fryer chicks, made bus easily. Dillan and Ashley got I-STEP results from last year, Dillan below average, Ashley above. Work was a bear. Left an hour late, construction on highway backed up for miles, had to call Lesa to get kids.</description>

      <description>Labor Day, no school, no work. Everyone slept in a little bit. The kids were cracking up when I started reading some of the old kid quotes. Kids very rambunctious and Lesa decided they needed exercise so after lunch we took them to Milwaukee Trail and walked to Wilson Park and back, that solved that. Took them to Jiffy Treat and stopped for milk before heading home. Dillan helped me put away tent.</description>

      <description>Woke up to Nerf gun fight in the house. Put a stop to that and started breakfast. Skipped church, everyone up too late, needed the sleep. Dillan and Gabe went to his house around 9, came back half-an-hour later with Gracie. All the kids had fun playing with each other even tough Lesa and I had our fill. They ate lunch with us and we sent them home. We discussed the night with Dillan and Ashley because we really didn&amp;#8217;t like some of the behavior we saw.</description>

      <description>Took Dillan to guitar lessons, not sure if he&amp;#8217;s learning anything but he seems to enjoy going, doesn&amp;#8217;t practice much. After lunch we all went with Lesa to get her hair cut at Fantastic Sams in Bedford and then went to Walmart to get Ashley some white tennis shoes for cheerleading. Let the kids get donuts too. Set up the tent for Dillan and Gabe, he&amp;#8217;s spending the night. Built a fire, we all joined in on marshmallows and s&amp;#8217;mores and hot dogs.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Friday and Labor Day weekend, we get Monday off. Totally missed the bus, dropped kids off at school. Payday Friday, so I bought donuts for the shop per usual. Long, long day! Got off work at 3:00p and even gave them an extra hour. Took long leisurely drive through the countryside to pick up kids, truck started having transmission problems half way there, didn&amp;#8217;t want to pull or kick down into lower gear.</description>

      <description>Barely made the bus, Kim waited for the kids to get on board. Took an alternate, scenic route to work, highway under construction and down to one lane. Spent most of day doing research. Lesa having her own problems at work. Both of us pretty zoned out by the time we get home. Mrs. Davis texted us, Dillan punched William in the eye and got in trouble for it. I was none to happy!</description>

      <description>Better at getting ready this morning, managed to get everything done, made bus easily. Scientia all day, got a crap load done even with build issues. Boys seemed ready to go home when I picked them up. Ashley had cheer practice, issues over her shoes not being good enough, learned movements to last weeks&amp;#8217; cheer, Lesa picked her up at school after practice. Dillan has brought his agenda home last two nights, did okay work for Dillan.</description>

      <description>Kids still tired after getting up, missed bus, dropped them off at school. Started workday at SAIC and went to Scientia mid-morning. Picked up kids late, they were making slime and got upset with me for coming so early. Ashley didn&amp;#8217;t take care of her rabbits until we got on her. She was having troubles, talked back to us a lot, got emotional a few times. Dillan had multiple meltdowns over doing his homework, cried, and general didn&amp;#8217;t want to do it, total drama.</description>

Worked in Bloomington and then SAIC around noon for rest of the day. Got ECT sensor from NAPA, then picked up kids. Kids stuck inside, boys not too bad, Ashley a mess, meltdown on lack of friends, another because Lesa doesn&amp;#8217;t love her enough, thinks she gets into trouble for disrespecting when Dillan pees the bed, blah, blah, blah, drama!</description>

After lunch, we went to Mike Pearson&amp;#8217;s to discuss the house, going forward, Lesa is comfortable, more so than me. Kids took A/V ride down to Ken and Cassie&amp;#8217;s place, we picked them up there, they were getting A/V rides and checked out a cave on their property.</description>

Went to Rural King and bought Ashley&amp;#8217;s pet play area, would be great for chickens, will be used for rabbits.</description>

      <description>Work/daycare, boys didn&amp;#8217;t go anywhere. Worked late, gave them couple extra pieces of candy. Planned on going to fair, rained, killed other outdoor options as well. Thought about going to a movie, didn&amp;#8217;t see any worthwhile. Played Sorry and Uno, boys had a blast kicking our butts!</description>

      <description>Different not having Dillan and Ashley around. Took boys to daycare, fair going on, no pool trip. SAIC, insecure about job. Boys played fairly well together, Bruce still a bit of a pill. Let them stay up later than usual to watch TV. I&amp;#8217;m either really tired or eyes are going bad.</description>

      <description>Tried sleeping in, denied! Lesa not up for zoo. Fowler&amp;#8217;s Pumpkin Patch instead: hayride, corn maze, pumpkins, animals. Bought fire pit. Lesa tired: Bob Evan&amp;#8217;s. Planned on yard camping, yard still wet, home too late, dark out, built fire anyway, roasted marshmallows, made S&amp;#8217;mores.</description>

      <description>Still sick, still doing better. Lesa picked up kids. I went to Open Arms after work, picked up brochures for Sunday &amp;#8211; and our adoption video from January 30th! Got home just in time for dinner. We watched the video and it hit home and reminded us why we do what we do. Praise God. </description>

Picked up kids, boys were outside, Ashley was inside helping clean up. Sounded like Bruce did okay. Slept a little, now it&amp;#8217;s bedtime.</description>

      <description>24 hours no medication, almost healthy but not yet. Day dragged by. Bruce proud of himself, didn&amp;#8217;t get in trouble, ran to tell me, had me check messages, good kid! Two loaves of zucchini bread from Sarah McCluskey, not as good as Lesa&amp;#8217;s, very dry. Passed out on couch. Off to bed!</description>

      <description>Holiday World! Couldn&amp;#8217;t find Sonja&amp;#8217;s free tickets, expensive getting in! Kids complained all day about everything but definitely had a great time! Mostly rides and wave pool. Ate at Fleig&amp;#8217;s Cafe in Ferinand (picked a place with lots of vehicles). Too much sun. Got home late, bed!</description>

      <description>Ashley slept the night through, praise God! She went to dentist with Lesa, had cavity filled, crown not necessary. Bruce had Humpty Dumpty lowered, wouldn&amp;#8217;t say why. Lesa and Ashley went shopping, got along all day without fighting, praise God! Picked up kids, rained, watched TV.</description>

      <description>Ashley is ill, patched her through the day, daycare suggested she may have roseola: rash, mild fever, and another child had it. She&amp;#8217;s sleeping soundly now which is great! Dentist for her tooth in the morning. Pitch, roll, yaw at work. Worked out after. Picked up kids. Bath night.</description>

Took taxes to H&amp;amp;R Block, ADP mistake, Schurz under-withheld on paycheck. Lowe&amp;#8217;s for thermostat. Tough bedtime too.</description>

Ashley and Dwyane to doctor, asked Ashley if she had hair down there, OMG, apparently she&amp;#8217;s old enough, OMG! Kids swam at Jessica&amp;#8217;s. Taste of India for lunch with Lesa.

Kids did okay at daycare, I think they&amp;#8217;d be happier at school. Realized I have to work on Bruce&amp;#8217;s first day of kindergarten, so disappointed!

      <description>Kids were quiet, slept until 8a! Went to Splash-O-Ree: swimming, bouncy house on the lake, row boats, paddle boats, kayaks, and fishing. Everyone had a great time! On the way home, my truck blew either the front diff or transfer case, will investigate more tomorrow. Slow evening.</description>

      <description>Slept in until 10, thank you Lesa! Kids super pump up all day long. We tried calming them down by playing games with them: Perfection, Operation, Ker‑Plunk. I spent 3 hours helping Dillan put together his LEGO City Police Station, now the other kids want one. Tacos! Tarzan movie.</description>

      <description>Family Sunday, kids insisted on group photo for some reason. After lunch started clearing camp in our woods. I ran into nest of yellow jackets, got stung twice! Moved camp to side yard, set up tent, gathered firewood for s&amp;#8217;mores, put out chairs, etc. After supper we went camping!</description>

      <description>On time! Work stressful. Hurricane Harvey effects finally reached us: cold, windy, rainy, dark. Bruce said &amp;#8216;F&amp;#8217; word at daycare, teachers upset, we&amp;#8217;re upset too. Pizza, TV trays, watched Spy Kids and Boss Baby, kids loved it! We could tell they&amp;#8217;re proud we&amp;#8217;re a family. A good day.</description>

We ate at Taste of India, picked kids up at Warehouse, and went home. I&amp;#8217;m stressed out! </description>

      <description>Sick and sore! Off at 2:30p, picked up kids, headed home. Got dryer unpacked, wired, new vent hose installed, and ready for first load all before Lesa got home; Ashley helped by handing me tools and parts; Dillan off playing with boys. Pizza! Stopped raining, colder. TV then bed.</description>

      <description>Kids better, I&amp;#8217;m miserable!. Ashley sneaked money to buy a &amp;#8220;Magic Pen&amp;#8221; but got caught. We all went to Springville Book Fair at school. Jenny met us there for visit then followed us home to finish it. Took Ashley to Menard&amp;#8217;s to pick up new washer/dryer set. Stormed, we got soaked! </description>

Jenny texted, wants to meet tomorrow on short notice, we&amp;#8217;ll accommodate, hoping there won&amp;#8217;t be many more! Dryer went kaput, found one online at Lowe&amp;#8217;s, said 7 in stock, had 0, I hate shopping! Sent kids to bed early. </description>

      <description>Felt like Thursday, it&amp;#8217;s not, everyone tired. Kids okay to be around. Bruce in trouble multiple times for hitting at daycare. Chickens laid candy eggs! Dillan tried to be affectionate. Lesa interacted more with kids: sat, cuddled, watched TV with them after dinner, they loved it!</description>

      <description>Back from Spring Break. Hectic workday. Lesa took Porter to vet: medicine, special food, not poison? We hope! Bruce tried wiping, got poop on himself/clothes. Kids played outside. Scouts, Ashley went, picked up trash at park, played after. She fell, huge knot on head, she&amp;#8217;s okay!</description>

      <description>Church/Jr Church. Dillan and Ashley participated well. Subway, Great Clips, Cascade Park. Played in/out doors. Looking a lot like Porter has been poisoned &amp;#8211; third dog since moving here, I&amp;#8217;m ready to execute a neighbor. Bruce pooped all over bathroom floor, WTF‽ Lesa read 4 books.</description>

      <description>Friday! Short workday. Talked with Annetta for an hour about kids. Bruce called her poopyhead, hides from teachers, spits, and other. Ashley smarts off. Dillan gets mad, follows wrong crowd, when leading makes poor choices. Dwyane good as always. Pizza! Watched The Good Dinosaur.</description>

      <description>Long day, feel better, Lesa and kids seem okay. Kids had good day at daycare, too cold to go out, full of spunk and energy, steeled myself for a night of crazy. Seriously wonder why we&amp;#8217;re adopting: we are too old! Taco supper, a favorite of everyone. Kids watched Despicable Me 2.</description>

      <description>Spring Break, kids happy. I&amp;#8217;m getting sick. Snowing, just in time for Spring. DST sucks, dark mornings, light at 7:30pm when boys go to bed. Kids played outside, came in when cold, started raising hell. Dillan, Ashley calmer because of tablet time. They&amp;#8217;re worn out from long day.</description>

Meeting for Dwyane&amp;#8217;s IEP, reduced to speech, ready for kindergarten. Ashley&amp;#8217;s Daisy investiture ceremony. Thunderstorms!</description>

      <description>Day two with truck, nice. Kids love it. On time everywhere. Worked over a little. Kids good at daycare, seemed happy to see me. Played outside, Dillan beat up Ashley, had to intervene, then he took Bruce&amp;#8217;s Big Wheel, intervened again, calmed down after that. He seems upset to me?</description>

      <description>Kids up early, little crazy people, still excited as hell. Sent them outside, rained, got muddy, back inside. Decided to skip naps so they&amp;#8217;d sleep tonight. Went to Walmart, got shoes all-around, other miscellaneous items. Jay C Plus for groceries. Tacos! Finding Dory on DVD. Bed.</description>

Worked over an hour, made up time off with Ashley at dentist. Picked up kids, Lesa, headed to C3 for Thanksgiving dinner. Surrounded by friends, I enjoyed.</description>

      <description>Election Day, voted for Hilary, looks like Trump might win. Kids excited about election for some reason, built up in school I guess.

      <description>Ashley sick, threw up all night, stayed until she fell back asleep. Dillan woke us up early yelling at the boys. Hauled the trash, all but Dillan went. Took Ashley to have prints made, ate lunch, she felt sick again. No one napped except Ashley, myself. Relaxed afternoon/evening.</description>

      <description>Friday! Another long workday, glad work week over! A few adoption emails, everything sent but one. Felt a bit better. Bruce took Ashley&amp;#8217;s photos, can&amp;#8217;t find them anywhere, she&amp;#8217;s devastated. Kids played outside all evening. Pizza! Ate normal, first time this week. Watched TV. Bed.</description>

      <description>Overslept but made it. Long workday, dragged on. Lots of adoption-related emails: background check waiver request letters; PRIs for Tammy Minger, financials too; two sets of four for Stephanie and DCS; hoping we&amp;#8217;re about done! Lesa picked up Dwyane and took to WIC. Big kid baths.</description>

      <description>Got into bed last night, found love note to Lesa and me from Ashley. I slept good! Went to SIRA for imaging on lump in right breast. Think it&amp;#8217;s reaction to medication, suggested surgery to remove if too painful, not cancer! Dillan homework, boys&amp;#8217; baths, some TV, bed. Quiet night!</description>

      <description>Church, Jr. Church. Lesa stayed home, worn out from yesterday, needed to recoup. Lesa took Dwyane shopping as reward for not wetting bed, other kids jealous. No one had naps. Made kids play outside. Set up badminton net, tried to teach kids to play, did pretty good. Danced, sang.</description>

      <description>Woke Dillan early, ate breakfast, headed to Maumee Camp for 2016 Cub Scout Shoot-O-Ree. Won at marbles, did good with most things, two-handed coordination things not his strong suit. Rained all day long but okay, we had great time! After supper watched TV, baths, bed! Lesa tired!</description>

Maumee camping trip with Dillan rained out, thunderstorms forecast but hasn&amp;#8217;t happened yet. Ordered a new 8&amp;#215;10, need three: Nicolle, Daniel, us. A Wreck-It Ralph, popcorn, root beer night.</description>

      <description>Ran late again. Long ass day! Worked 11 hours, pretty much exhausted! Lesa picked up kids. Ate reheated Hamburger Helper for supper &amp;#8211; not Lesa&amp;#8217;s usual affair, but best she could do while handling kids without me. School pictures. Dillan lost 8&amp;#215;10, bent two others. I got very mad!</description>

Let school know Dillan and Ashley in late tomorrow for dentist appointment. Ashley made us &amp;#8220;I love you&amp;#8221; book. Lesa in good mood. Had 101.7 fever.</description>

      <description>Overslept, made it everywhere on time. Talked with Billie Landstrom about keeping kids. Dillan struggled with math homework. Completed Scout requirements for Running with the Pack. Kids watched The Incredibles, ate popcorn, drank lemonade. Feeling mixed emotions, sad for Nicolle.</description>

      <description>Up early. From 11-2 Dillan sold Scout popcorn. Went to JayC first. Wrong! IGA was the place. Sold $265 in popcorn plus $40 donations. Met quota, covered expenses for year. Steak &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; Shake lunch, chocolate shakes! Late lunch ruined taco supper. 101 Dalmatians. I felt sick all day.</description>

      <description>Friday! Pizza! Kids wanted to look at burned house. Kids acting up a lot, know we&amp;#8217;re keeping them, not on best behavior anymore. They&amp;#8217;re right, we&amp;#8217;re stuck with them! Grade cards, everything&amp;#8217;s great but we know different, Dillan is struggling. Paperwork for Dillan&amp;#8217;s testing came.</description>

      <description>Dwyane glad to go to school, thrill worn off for Dillan and Ashley. Kids played outside before eating, did homework after, both lied about having any. Ashley cleaned under her bed! Big kid baths. Didn&amp;#8217;t have normal problem getting kids to bed, tired? Stormed, thunder scared kids.</description>

      <description>Not much to say. Dillan still having attitude and anger issues, probably will for a long time, maybe always. Per usual, Bruce is mischievous as all-get-out. Dwyane is like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, sometimes demon and sometimes angel. Ashley is the quintessential spoiled princess.</description>

Lesa arranged Ashley&amp;#8217;s Scouts at Needmore on Tuedays. On way home drove by wreck, hurt kids, kids saw. Picked up mums at feeder auction.</description>

      <description>Up at 8:15! Breakfast, headed to Karst Farm Park in Bloomington. Bruce scared hell out of me at park, played in sandbox, had picnic lunch. Got wet at Splash Pad. Home, napped, played, watched movie. Later Dillan refused to help, I got mad, threw cars in woods. Almost a great day.</description>

Took Dillan on long drive/talk; mad at brothers, bio-parents, thinks I&amp;#8217;m too rough; sad about uncles, grandpa; no hesitation, he wants us to adopt; Wendy’s lunch. Napped with Bruce. Cooked out supper. Shot fireworks. Camped with Ashley. Today better than yesterday!</description>

Stephanie, Amber, and SNAP Specialist Brenda Stoner came over, spent all evening with them, talked adoption with us, Stephanie told kids. Things are getting real. Scary!</description>

Lesa called, Jeep wouldn&amp;#8217;t run, got it going, followed her home. Picked up kids. Took Dillan, Ashley to Advance Auto; put new battery in Jeep.</description>

By the time I picked up kids my energy was gone, turns out Lesa was even more exhausted. Managed to help with homework and baths. Bed!</description>

Lunch at Bo Rick&amp;#8217;s, great coney dogs, hand-made onion rings. Still trying to process, it&amp;#8217;s all so surreal. We wonder who did most harm &amp;#8211; mom and dad, or DCS?</description>

      <description>Shoals for case files day two. Scanned a ton! Not sure of value but rather have it than not, kids can decide when grown. Learning stuff we didn&amp;#8217;t know but mostly same thing time-and-again, a lot depressing! Had Faytastic ranch and chicken pizza, probably best pizza I&amp;#8217;ve ever had!</description>

Lesa has cold, poor girl was miserable. Velma&amp;#8217;s for lunch. Learned much, filled in some missing pieces, many holes remain!</description>

Dillan is a Wolf Scout, looks like I&amp;#8217;m the Den Leader, old one is in hospital with liver failure, crap! The things we do for these kids!</description>

      <description>Friday! Pizza! Bruce pottied in toilet all day. Lesa took Ashley to eye doctor. Dillan tutoring. Feeling sadness, sorrow, joyless: TPR had to happen! Not optimal outcome, better if bio-parents got well years ago, kids will forever deal with being adopted, celebration feels wrong.</description>

      <description>Dillan tutoring scheduled, transportation arranged, such relief! My night for homework with him, disaster! Wound up lecturing him. Doesn&amp;#8217;t know sight words, phonetics, or how to sound out words. Can&amp;#8217;t do single digit addition either, worried for him! Fell, hit his head, has knot!</description>

      <description>Ashley Kindergarten Graduation! Wonderful time! Bittersweet: sad/glad she&amp;#8217;s growing up; but much too fast! Afterward took her to Judah-Logan park before going to daycare, wish we could&amp;#8217;ve gone home but have to work, work can suck sometimes! I&amp;#8217;m mad over call about testing Dillan.</description>

      <description>Much better day! Dwyane super proud of new Paw Patrol backpack. Annetta Starr dressed in Easter Bunny outfit when I picked kids up from daycare, Bruce afraid of big characters, won&amp;#8217;t go near! Rained off-and-on, kids stuck inside. Dillan tried to be loving, I can tell it&amp;#8217;s forced.</description>

      <description>Kids on my nerves again! Dwyane field trip to park. Daycare asked me to talk to Ashley: bullying a boy; throwing rocks, cedar chips. Had talk, no desert. Bruce choked at supper, almost had to intervene. Dwyane bit Bruce, drew blood. Never thought I&amp;#8217;d say Dillan behaving the best.</description>

      <description>Nice day out today, upper 30s; kids had too much homework to play outside though. Dillan&amp;#8217;s teacher Chelsea Wronowicz texted me wanting to have a sit-down to discuss his 2nd grade future; first grade present not going so well so we need to set some goals for him. He wants to play.</description>

      <description>Kids didn&amp;#8217;t mind 2-hr school delay! Went to work; business as usual. Worked 9.5 hours for 3rd day; 5 hours over for week; will go to CFTM tomorrow. Kids will never know what we go through for them. 10 hour days on worst snow days really sucks. Kids worth it, but there are days&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Junior Church leader, Ashley and Dillan enjoyed my presence. Snowed, no accumulation. I took Bruce to doctor, thought pink eye but not; had good time together. Ashley a pill, not listening, wanting to argue. Super cold! Changed brake master on Lesa&amp;#8217;s Jeep. Got kids into bed late.</description>

Went to Golden Corral; found out during &amp;#8220;How was your day?&amp;#8221; discussions Dillan had to move stick twice for talking and interrupting; no dessert for him, he took it well. Ashley worried she can&amp;#8217;t stay with us forever.</description>

      <description>I woke up angry at 6a, again at 7a, to kids fighting. Lesa took Dillan to Tractor Supply for pine shavings; he bought tractor trailer with $10 Christmas money; Lesa chipped in $2. Kids super-hyper! Took down tree, lights, most decorations. Lasagna dinner at Paul and Andrea Fries!</description>

      <description>New Year&amp;#8217;s Eve! Last day at Alicia&amp;#8217;s. Kids in disbelief when told Christmas Break is about over. Ate pizza so we can have cabbage and black-eyed peas tomorrow. Just another day to kids but Lesa and I managed to stay awake to kiss and bring in new year. Will 2016 be good for kids?</description>

      <description>Kids had fun when Alicia took them outside to see her horses. Dwyane head-butted Ashley getting into truck; gusher of a nose bleed followed; wanted to eat out but nose still bleeding. Dillan and Bruce fought during prayer; made them eat by themselves after everyone else finished.</description>

      <description>Day two at Alicia&amp;#8217;s; kids not so hyped. Sun came out but temps dropped. Saw Brian Faubian on way home. Kids much better behaved compared to last few days! I&amp;#8217;m exhausted, almost fell asleep during supper; Lesa noticed, ran baths for big kids, and let me snooze in chair. Bless her!</description>

      <description>Christmas over; Dwyane says no presents under tree. Back to work. Daycare closed so kids went to Alicia Rainey&amp;#8217;s in Heltonville, our old stomping grounds. Travel time sets me back at least 1&amp;frasl;2 each way plus raining, bridge out, bottoms flooded. They enjoyed going! Still wound up!</description>

      <description>Normal day, got off work on time, felt halfway decent. Lesa got home late so we had pizza again. Hey, it&amp;#8217;s Friday, it&amp;#8217;s pizza, it&amp;#8217;s all good! Kids stayed up later than usual. We watched Christmas shows. Bruce and Dwyane were afraid of the Bumble on Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer.</description>

      <description>Springville water out for over 24 hours; have lots of clean water. Ashley called: she knows phone number! Bruce WIC. Pizza! Getting support for yesterday; people shocked; prayers we don&amp;#8217;t mourn losing kids &amp;#8211; kids don&amp;#8217;t mourn losing us. Trying to remember God is good all the time!</description>

      <description>Left work for court. Judge ordered DCS to start over: reunification, visits, new Disposition Hearing in January. Guardian ad Litem told court she&amp;#8217;s filing separate termination for 15 of 22 months out of home. Kids in limbo, maybe worse. Stephanie to take kids for new psych evals.</description>

Stephanie came over; knows nothing about tomorrow; hard for me to believe. Sandy Bowman filing for termination tomorrow? THIS IS THEIR HOME!</description>

Tried to work over to cover Wednesday&amp;#8217;s time off for court but just too miserable; took nap as soon as I got home.

Naps, kids played outside, supper, some TV. Been a really rough weekend; kids have been really worked up; and we&amp;#8217;re really tired!</description>

That didn&amp;#8217;t look good! Declined Jumpin&amp;#8217; Joey&amp;#8217;s BD party due to a dinner invite, dinner cancelled too. Oh well.</description>

Took kids to see really cool Christmas light display, synced with Christmas music, in Springville. Kids danced, sang along.</description>

      <description>Two years today since the kids came to live with us; we&amp;#8217;ve certainly come a long way! It&amp;#8217;s been a life-changing experience; not one I would ever do again, but not one I would undo either. To celebrate we went to Bob Evan&amp;#8217;s, thanked God for blessings, and ate breakfast for dinner.</description>

      <description>Ten hour work day; I&amp;#8217;m exhausted. Kids seem to be tired also judging by all the yawns. Dillan and Ashley did homework and watched TV; babies got baths. Tomorrow makes two years exactly since the kids came to live with us. Talked to Lesa about celebrating by going out for Mexican.</description>

Dwyane&amp;#8217;s school called; said he didn&amp;#8217;t make it in; after my heart attack learned it was wrong child! Still sick from medicine; coughing up crap.</description>

Working late all week so I can make gingerbread house with Ashley at school tomorrow. Went to Scouts; Dillan played a game he liked a lot; he has a new den leader.</description>

      <description>Family Sunday! Lesa and Ashley went to &amp;#8220;The Nutcracker&amp;#8221; at IU! So jealous! I wanted to take her; it was my idea! Took boys to McDonald&amp;#8217;s; stayed home with them: an exercise in patience. Let Dillan skip nap, play with neighbors. Watched Spider-Man. Ashley had case of the specials.</description>

Let her sleep while we prayed. She was in her jammies so I carried her to bed without her waking up. I love this memory!</description>

Options: 1) try to terminate without it; 2) judge sign it, roll everything back to March 2014, and start over. CASA coming tomorrow to discuss situation with us. Contested adoption?

Kids ran their fool heads off in the rain and mud; through the spruces, the firs, and pines. We eventually settled on a nice fir for our tree. Got it home and set up.</description>

Lesa took kids to Walmart and Dollar Tree to buy toys as reward for their excellent midterm reports; ten $1.00 toys each. Watched a lot of TV since it was cold and wet outside.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sick; I slept almost all day. I missed Hope Harvest. Lesa cared for the kids and me &amp;#8211; poor woman; she&amp;#8217;s a candidate for saint. Kids played indoors, and outside with neighbor kids on swing set. I grilled salmon. Everyone went to bed early. Smell of mentholatum fills the house.</description>

      <description>Friday! Off at 2:15p. Bedford to pay water bill. Played Wii with kids. Case Conference in Shoals at 6:30p. Missed supper with family, sucks! Mom a no-show.

      <description>Deer hunted in AM, too windy, nothing moved, didn&amp;#8217;t even see birds or squirrels. Bloomington ReStore, looked for dining room chairs—no luck. Steak &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; Shake to celebrate kids&amp;#8217; grades, then College Mall&amp;#8217;s The Toy Store, bought the kids a toy each. Hunted in PM, stormed. Tacos! TV.</description>

      <description>Almost Thanksgiving! Kids last day of school. Rambunctious, especially Ashley; lots of screaming from all kids. Busy work day, productive but still dragged by. Bruce seems aware of his behavior &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s great! Still not potty trained though. Lesa took Ashley to Daisy pizza party.</description>
