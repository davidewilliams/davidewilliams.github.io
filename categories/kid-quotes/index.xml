      <description>We saw a wreck on the way home. At bedtime Ashley said: Daddy, I pray you don’t get in a wreck. I would be so sad and lonesome, and I would cry every day for two months, and then I would die too &amp;#8211; cause that happens you know. People die from loneliness. Dave: You would maybe be sad but you wouldn’t be alone and I wouldn’t want you to die so young and miss out on your life.</description>

      <description>I was doing 60 mph in a 55 mph zone when I passed a patrol car going the opposite way, and said: Oh crap, I hope he doesn&amp;#8217;t turn around. All the kids turned their heads to look, and sure enough, the patrol car turned around, and headed back toward us. The kids yelled: He&amp;#8217;s turning around! Dave: He&amp;#8217;d better hurry or he won&amp;#8217;t see which way I&amp;#8217;m turning and he&amp;#8217;ll have to guess (as I made a left onto 54 toward Bloomfield).</description>

Daddy, i got a gift with babies.</description>

Dave: I think she&amp;#8217;s 33, maybe 34. My Mom, overhearing, said: No, I&amp;#8217;m 39. Ashley, looking closely at my Mom, said: No, you&amp;#8217;re not 39. You&amp;#8217;re a lot older! </description>

      <description>The boys woke up before light and were in their room playing with the door closed. Lesa saw the bathroom light was on and turned it off. The boys noticed the bathroom light wasn&amp;#8217;t shining under their door anymore and it got really quiet in their room. Then Lesa heard Dwyane say: Remember, God is with you, God is with you. Then the door cracked open, and Bruce slowly stuck his head out the door.</description>

Dave: What Bruce? Are you going to tattle tale on someone too? Bruce: No! Dillan quickly said: I will! Dave: So Bruce, what were you going to say?</description>

Ashley: So when she grows up and gets married to another boy Dillan will be sad? Dave: I doubt it. He&amp;#8217;ll probably like another girl by then. Ashley, incredulously: He will? Dave: Of course he will. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Ashley: I&amp;#8217;ve heard that before.</description>

And I&amp;#8217;ve been hit with [toy] cars and [toy] trucks, and I&amp;#8217;ve been kicked and hit and pinched by all the boys, and I was pushed off the bed and snapped my neck, and I&amp;#8217;ve been pushed down the stairs and fell down the stairs too.</description>

      <description>[Bruce was helping Lesa in the kitchen while she was cooking dinner. He helped with the eggs, then he wanted to help with something else. Bruce noticed that the plastic container drawer wasn&amp;#8217;t closed. Lesa told him it wouldn&amp;#8217;t close because the plastic containers needed to be organized. Bruce went ahead and organized it for Lesa! Wow! It closes now.] Then Lesa wanted to feed the chickens. She handed Bruce an ear of corn and asked him to shuck it (he&amp;#8217;s shucked corn before).</description>

      <description>Ashley: Daddy, it&amp;#8217;s almost Mother&amp;#8217;s Day. Dave: I know, and I haven&amp;#8217;t gotten Mommy anything yet. Dwyane: We should get her flowers. Dave: Flowers are nice. Mommy likes flowers but flowers don&amp;#8217;t last very long. That&amp;#8217;s kind of what makes them special though. Bruce: Get her a ring! Dave: A ring? Bruce: What goes on her ears. Dave: You mean earrings. Bruce: Yeah, they&amp;#8217;ll last until fireworks time! Dwyane: Yeah, I think Mommy needs rings.</description>

Dave: Yeah, but when&amp;#8217;s the last time you saw toys and clothes growing on trees? Dillan: Never! Ashley: Can we get some of those kinds of trees?</description>

      <description>Bruce: There&amp;#8217;s witches! Dave: Where? Bruce: In the truck! Dave: I don&amp;#8217;t see any witches in the truck. Dwyane: They&amp;#8217;re in the back. Lots of them! Dave: I don&amp;#8217;t see any witches. Why aren&amp;#8217;t they getting you? Are you boy witches? Dwyane, sounding incredulous: We&amp;#8217;re just kids Daddy. I&amp;#8217;m a kid, Bruce is a kid, and you&amp;#8217;re a Daddy! Dave: Okay, I still don&amp;#8217;t see any witches though. Bruce: If witches try to get us you will get them, right Daddy?</description>

      <description>My niece Sarah Mae starts her new career with DCS on May 31 and as such she has decided it is now her responsibility to police my Kid Quotes. She considers them dangerous and too personal to be put on Facebook. Since I already have four kids and don&amp;#8217;t want the drama of a fifth child, I have decided to suspend my Facebook Kid Quotes indefinitely. I will still keep them for us and the kids, I&amp;#8217;m just not going to post them on Facebook any longer.</description>

E-I-E-I-O.
And on his farm he had some breakfast!
E-I-E-I-O.
Eat your breakfast here!
Eat your breakfast there!
Eat your breakfast, eat your breakfast,
Eat your breakfast everywhere!
Big ol&amp;#8217; Daddy had a farm,

      <description>Ashley, at dinner: Maybe some husbands could cook so little girls&amp;#8217; mommies can play with them because they only have brothers and no other girls to play with? Ashley: Or maybe some other girl who&amp;#8217;s mommy and daddy doesn&amp;#8217;t take care of her and be nice to her can find nice people to take care of her. And then those nice people can take one of the boys [she looks at Dillan] and send to other nice people and then it would be even &amp;#8211; two girls and two boys.</description>

      <description>[The kids are always trying to &amp;#8220;scare&amp;#8221; me and don&amp;#8217;t understand how it is that I&amp;#8217;m not scared. I always tell them those kinds of things don&amp;#8217;t scare me. Then I tell them something bad happening to Lesa or them is what scares me; like getting hurt, or being really sick, or not getting to stay with us. Then last Wednesday Ashley fell from the monkey bars at school and bit her lip and had a bloody nose.</description>

      <description>Dillan, after shooting his 2-liter bottle rocket at the Cub Scout Shoot-O-Ree, yelled: That was totally awesome! [Then he stood there posing like he was trying to let everyone know they needed to admire his launch, and that they should be taking notes &amp;#8211; or better yet they might as well just stop and go home since it was obvious there was no way anyone would ever top that given all of time.</description>

      <description>On Saturday, Ashley had Lesa help her count her money. She had $10.51. Ashley: Mommy, I want to give school money. They need it really bad. Lesa: Ashley, Dave and I give money to the school, so you don&amp;#8217;t need to. Ashley: Well, can I give money to church? Lesa: That would be a wonderful thing to do. So, she fished out a dollar bill and literally carried it all day Saturday and again on Sunday until she was able to give it to church on Sunday morning.</description>

Dave: People want to help us because they want to show God&amp;#8217;s love through them, and because they know how expensive and hard it must be to take care of four kids that aren&amp;#8217;t our kids yet, and because they want to make you kids feel better and have fun and not be sad.</description>

      <description>[Our rule making process goes something like this: We noticed sometimes people get down from the table to play or do other stuff and then they want to come back to the table and eat some more. We feel like we need a rule about getting down from the table while we&amp;#8217;re eating so we know when everyone is done and can start cleaning up dishes and stuff. We think that if people are going to be getting down from the table they must not be very hungry anymore, so maybe those people should be done eating; unless of course they got down to get more food or to go to the bathroom.</description>

Daddy, when I grow up, I&amp;#8217;m going to buy you &amp;#8230;
&amp;#8230; a new truck &amp;#8211; a bigger truck &amp;#8211; a red truck.
&amp;#8230; a bigger house so we can have more room.
&amp;#8230; a bigger swimming pool so we can have more fun without the babies.
&amp;#8230; a bigger trailer so we can haul the really big stuff.
&amp;#8230; a monster truck so we can race each other.</description>

Ashley: Angels live in clouds and you said fog is like clouds touching the ground so we&amp;#8217;re running over angels, right? Dave: No, I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure they&amp;#8217;re smart enough not to get run over. Dillan: How? Dave: Maybe they&amp;#8217;re on top of the cloud, or on a different cloud. Anyway, I don&amp;#8217;t see any.</description>

      <description>Ashley singing: Mom-my Le-sa is so pret-ty.
Mom-my Le-sa is so pret-ty.
Mom-my Le-sa is so pret-ty.
I love and like Mom-my Lesa. Dad-dy Dave is so pret-ty.
I mean Dad-dy Dave is so hand-some.
Dad-dy Dave is so hand-some.
Dwyane-y and Bruce-y and Dad-dy Dave is so hand-some.
Dad-dy Dave is hand-some-est cause he is gray.
I love and like Dad-dy Dave. Daddy? Do you like my new song? </description>

      <description>Ashley, talking about &amp;#8220;Our Field&amp;#8221; again: Next time I will get mad. I don&amp;#8217;t like turkeys and deers that don&amp;#8217;t let peoples see them! That&amp;#8217;s just mean, right Daddy? Dave: Maybe something scared them all away and now they&amp;#8217;re afraid? Ashley, sounding dubious: We&amp;#8217;ll see. </description>

      <description>[Every day on the way to daycare I drive by a certain field. It is &amp;#8220;Our Field&amp;#8221; and on most days we see deer and/or turkeys. This past week we haven&amp;#8217;t seen either which is kind of odd.] Dave to Ashley: Nothing! I don&amp;#8217;t see anything again. Do you? Ashley: No. Maybe the turkeys are in timeout. Dave: In timeout? I didn&amp;#8217;t know turkeys got timeouts. What do you think they did?</description>

      <description>Ashley: Daddy, did you slow down because you saw that cat? Dave: Yes. I&amp;#8217;ve never hit a cat or dog and I hope I never do. Ashley: Some people are stupid and run over animals because they don&amp;#8217;t want to see any animals any more. Dave: Sometimes they can&amp;#8217;t help it because animals sometimes run out in front of your car. Ashley: Like squirrels and bunnies? Dave: Yup. Ashley: The Easter Bunny is big and white so no one would run over him but they might run over his helpers.</description>
