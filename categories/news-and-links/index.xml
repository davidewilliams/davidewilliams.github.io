 Good Morning,
Ms. Hulsey requested that I provide the namesakes for the children to you so that you can provide it to the foster/adoptive parents.
&amp;nbsp;
 Dillan Levi &amp;#8211; I choose Dillan&amp;#8217;s first name the day he was born, the moment I saw his face the name came to me. I picked Levi as his middle name after a dear family friend who had passed, Dustin Levi Kelley.</description>

I never wish the pain that I feel in my whole body on anyone in the world. Not even the caseworker that has led me down this road. I have (had) four beautiful babies and coming up in the beginning of July I&amp;#8217;m signing my rights over. I have not gotten to speak or see my babies since 2014 my youngest was 6 months old then.</description>

Day 11 in kindergarten! When doing our calendar activities every day, we look at the date, predict patterns, identify the weather and add to our weather graph, talk about events that are happening today, tomorrow, next week, etc., and identify shapes. We sing about the days of the week (to the tune of &amp;#8220;The Addams Family&amp;#8221;), months of the year (tune of &amp;#8220;Ten Little Indians&amp;#8221;) and the seasons (tune of &amp;#8220;The Ants Go Marching&amp;#8221;).</description>

Our special visitor in kindergarten today was Zero the Hero. Without him, we could only count to 9! By adding a zero, we can make more and more numbers. Your child colored a picture to show you what Zero the Hero looks like. (He is a pop up puppet.) Each 10th day, when he visits, we sing his song to get him to appear, we do some sort of activity, and we write numbers.</description>

Another busy day in kindergarten! (At least no emergency drills today.) We have used our Syllable Book to practice writing letters and counting syllables. This is only the second time we have done this so far (A page, and now the B page), and the kids have already caught on to the procedure! We celebrated Black Day by telling about the black items that we brought or wore.</description>

The week has gotten off to a great start! We introduced the letter &amp;#8216;B&amp;#8217; this morning when our letter puppet, Marvin the Mouse, brought the &amp;#8216;B&amp;#8217; letter cards for us. Marvin is a little shy; he will only whisper to me and I have to tell the kids what he said. After making sure we knew how to write the letter and what the sound was, we practiced.</description>

Kindergarten fun: This morning we learned the song &amp;#8216;Tooty Ta&amp;#8217;. In addition to the giggles and laughs, the kids are learning to listen and follow directions. We started our &amp;#8216;Oreo Cookie Book&amp;#8217;, using the word &amp;#8216;am&amp;#8217;. Whenever we introduce a new word that has 2 letters, we call this an &amp;#8216;Oreo cookie word&amp;#8217; and write it in our book.</description>

More great times in kindergarten! We started our Special Person of the Day this morning. The Special Person (SP) unscrambles the letter of his/her name using the magnetic letters. Then we do a cheer using their name, with the SP leading the cheer. (Only boys with muscles can be cheerleaders; look at IU or any other college.:&amp;gt;). Next we interview the SP to learn about some of their favorite things (learning to ask questions) and describe that person (learning observation skills).</description>

We are having our first birthday celebration in kindergarten today. (I won&amp;#8217;t name names on Facebook, but your child should know who.) This morning we sang &amp;#8216;Happy birthday&amp;#8217;, using the word cards. The birthday child then mixed up the cards and we had to read them in the new order and then sing them. :&amp;gt;) We also formed a circle around the b-day child and an inflatable birthday cake, while we sang &amp;#8220;Zippity Doo Dah&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8216;plenty of wishes going &amp;#8212;&amp;#8216;s way&amp;#8217;) and then clapped 6 times for 6 years old.</description>

Another great morning in kindergarten! The kids went to PE this morning with our PE teacher. (Thanks to all of the parents for remembering to have your kids wear their tennis shoes!) Tomorrow they will get to go to Music Class and are asked to wear/have tennis shoes again. We also had a Chester Chase this morning. Upon reading &amp;#8220;The Kissing Hand&amp;#8221;, we found a note from Chester, the raccoon, in the back of the book, telling us to go to the office.</description>

To my kindergarten parents: We have had another great day! The kids are doing a wonderful job remembering our procedures and things are going very smoothly! We did a reading lesson this morning, learning about the words &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;am&amp;#8221;. We started our journals with the letter &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217;. As we do every day, we did our calendar activities on the bulletin board, and then worked in our calendar book.</description>

Just to let everyone that has kids in my classroom &amp;#8211; we have had a WONDERFUL morning. No tears and a lot of smiles! (I&amp;#8217;m not going to tag people because I might forget someone, so feel free to tag anyone that you think is interested.) The kids are at lunch right now and will have recess afterwards. Then it&amp;#8217;s rest time, reading &amp;#8220;Chicka Chicka Boom Boom&amp;#8221;, and starting our own &amp;#8220;How Many Coconuts?</description>

And that is exactly what the Hatchet softball team experienced, during a a 12-0 drubbing of Shoals on Monday at the Sports Complex.
And as coach Alan Lemon likes to say, &amp;#8220;They hit the ball with hardness.&amp;#8221;
The triples from Kendra Veale and Michelle Hulsey, was followed by the dinger from Kiersten Hinkle in a first inning that saw the Hatchets score 11 runs on 10 hits.</description>
