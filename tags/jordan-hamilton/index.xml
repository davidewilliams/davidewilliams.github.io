      <description>Christmas! Santa came, left candy coal for Dillan but we added a few more gifts. Indy to Grandpa Avery and Grandma Bonnie&amp;#8217;s house after our Christmas morning. Kids got to played with lots of their cousins, had a great time! Memories. I felt sick going, during, on way back, still.</description>

      <description>Same old morning/workday/afternoon. Finished antibiotics, feel much better than a month ago, wish Lesa would get better too. Kids watched TV. Jordan finished PAVA pics, they&amp;#8217;re awesome! Backgrounds and Facebook immediately! Spent evening ordering for Nicolle, Daniel, and Rebecca. </description>

      <description>Skipped church. Southeastway Park in Indy for 3rd PAVA photo session, Jordan Hamilton took pics again, played a few minutes at park. Kids total pills, I yelled lots. Tried to eat Greek in Greenwood, closed forever. Wound up eating at King Gyro in Bloomington, a poor substitution. </description>
