      <description>Dear, Dillan, Ashley, Dwyane &amp;amp; Daniel,
How are all of you doing this week? I hope
you have been okay. I often wonder if
you are happy or not. I have suffered
from depression my entire life and still do.
I fear I may have passed this on to you through
my actions, poor choices, and of course genetics.
I always tell myself if I get to hold you one</description>

      <description>Dear kids,
When I wrote this it was two days before Thanksgiving, they are
giving us chicken breasts, mash potatoes &amp;amp; stuffing. A pretty good
meal considering. I miss you all so much, I know
it seems like forever but this will eventually only be a brief
moment in time. I will wait patiently for as long as it
takes in order to hold you in my arms again. I love you</description>

      <description>Dear Children,
I love you guys so much I think of you everyday &amp;amp; night.
Are you guys going to be doing any Christmas carroling this
year? I know people would love to get visits from angels like
all of you. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you guys ever pay visits to any nursing
homes or elderly people, but they love the company. I talk to your
grandpa, my father, about twice a week, he is living in Florida</description>

      <description>My name is David Williams. I&amp;#8217;m leaning toward Plan 1 and here’s why.
I have four children at Springville. They&amp;#8217;re getting a quality education. They have teachers that know and care about them, and the kids know and care about the teachers too. I’m concerned that will change.
My daughter is a cheerleader. I’m concerned consolidation will hurt her chances of making the squad.
My boys want to play basketball. There are only x number of spots on a team.</description>

      <description>Work/daycare, boys didn&amp;#8217;t go anywhere. Worked late, gave them couple extra pieces of candy. Planned on going to fair, rained, killed other outdoor options as well. Thought about going to a movie, didn&amp;#8217;t see any worthwhile. Played Sorry and Uno, boys had a blast kicking our butts!</description>

      <description>Different not having Dillan and Ashley around. Took boys to daycare, fair going on, no pool trip. SAIC, insecure about job. Boys played fairly well together, Bruce still a bit of a pill. Let them stay up later than usual to watch TV. I&amp;#8217;m either really tired or eyes are going bad.</description>

      <description>Kids daycare, Mitchell Pool, all went well. Lesa sick now, still worked. I&amp;#8217;m still sick but feel like I&amp;#8217;m getting better, did 9 hours at SAIC. Picked up kids, rushed home, scarfed supper, took kids to their ballgame, they suck, Lesa stayed home and rested. American Ninja Warrior.</description>

      <description>Peace and quiet in house, everyone&amp;#8217;s noticed: Dillan at camp. Storming, headed straight toward him, Lesa worried he&amp;#8217;s in a tent. Lesa took kids to dentist, Ashley having issues around spacer but not to worry yet, all need to brush better, thankfully no cavities. Moana before bed.</description>

      <description>No church, lazy morning, early lunch. Loaded Dillan&amp;#8217;s gear, drove to Camp Maumee, waited an hour for Scout Leader Albert Cross, another hour while camps got switched. Stormed, rushed gear to shelter, said goodbye, left. Beauty and the Beast, Incredibles. Good night / luck Dillan!</description>

      <description>What a long day! Packed 4 boxes of cookies around, 1 for daycare, 1 for school, 2 for my work.

I&amp;#8217;m wore out!</description>

      <description>2-hour delay became school closure, took kids to daycare, can&amp;#8217;t afford another day off, I hate that. Feel like job is slipping away, trying not to panic. Worked over, late getting kids, rushed supper. Ashley had Scouts, we had Oneness class. Lesa made chili for my lunch pitch-in.</description>

      <description>Fairly normal morning/day. Mrs Harp sent Dillan&amp;#8217;s report card home early, and a note: seven Fs, one B in Art, several failed assignments, plus 19 missing! I was livid, grounded him from playing! Scout Pack meeting, many awards, Ashley went too. Record-breaking deep freeze on way.</description>

      <description>I was doing 60 mph in a 55 mph zone when I passed a patrol car going the opposite way, and said: Oh crap, I hope he doesn&amp;#8217;t turn around. All the kids turned their heads to look, and sure enough, the patrol car turned around, and headed back toward us. The kids yelled: He&amp;#8217;s turning around! Dave: He&amp;#8217;d better hurry or he won&amp;#8217;t see which way I&amp;#8217;m turning and he&amp;#8217;ll have to guess (as I made a left onto 54 toward Bloomfield).</description>

      <description>1-14-19 Dear Diary,
I got to go home with Bruce Williams. His mom and dad were so excited to see me again and I was excited to see Dillan, Ashley, and Dwyane again. Even the dogs remembered me! It is a little sad that tonight might be the last time at Bruce&amp;#8217;s house.
One of the first things Bruce and I did was go sledding down the hill. Then we ate dinner and I sat at the table next to Bruce and his mom.</description>

      <description>Dear, David and Lisa.
This is Daniel.
This letter is long overdue, and the truth is I have been a little scared to write it.
There are so many things to say and ask, but I guess the best way is to take it one step at a time and start at the Beginning.
Thank you so much for everything you do, you have been a mericle for me and the children.</description>

      <description>Seems like kids fought all day. Lesa did eggs for &amp;#8220;Devil&amp;#8221; eggs, I took out three bags trash. Christmas at my mom and dad’s in Indy, kids had lots of fun playing with cousins. Yahtzee with kids, then by ourselves after kids&amp;#8217; bedtime. Marcy Cook texted about a villa in French Lick.</description>

      <description>I worked, kids went to daycare, Lesa stayed home/went grocery shopping. I picked them up, heard all the stories: Dillan was hitting Bruce, Bruce was biting, etc. Kids have obviously lost their minds. Got home, more of same. Pizza, Dillan almost got sick eating whole pepperoncini.</description>

      <description>Hi Rebecca,
We received your letter of July 16.
We rented a PO Box from the United States Postal Service expressly for correspondence with Daniel and Nicolle. Clay Cummings, Daniel&amp;#8217;s lawyer at the time, alerted us to an issue. It appeared mail sent to it was either returned or lost. We have no idea what was sent or what we missed. We were unable to convince the USPS of the problem.</description>

      <description>Still sick, hacked all day/night. Picked up kids, they seemed to have a nice day. Bruce got a Hudson High Five, he was stoked! Ashley didn&amp;#8217;t have piano lessons. Helped Bruce make his egg toss box, Lesa helped him decorate. Dillan went to Gabe&amp;#8217;s. I finally got grass cut. Bed time.</description>

      <description>Downright miserable workday, left two hours early, went to Bedford walk-in clinic, no strep or mono or flu, some other viral-type infection. Picked up kids. Took Dillan and Dwyane to Scouts, popcorn sales kickoff party. Spoke with JOINT Services about Dillan&amp;#8217;s IEP, not too happy.</description>

Lesa took kids to get mail, came back with Dillan&amp;#8217;s friend Gabe and sister Gracie. Lesa is a saint, watched kids entire day by herself, not easy for her. Slept!</description>

Small stray terrier chased chickens, they scattered into woods, took us over an hour to round them up. Dillan hasn&amp;#8217;t been bringing school work home.</description>

Dave: We’d die. Bruce: If a big wind came and blew us off? Dave: We’d still die. Dwyane: If there was a hole in the fence and we slipped through? Dave: You’d die.

      <description>Waited for bus with kids. School, daycare, work. Work was intense. Picked up kids. Bruce fighting with kid over LEGOs. Ashley coughing a lot, has sore throat, ragweed? Hoping not strep! Dillan decided to bring home his homework. Ashley had piano lessons, could tell she practiced.</description>

      <description>Lesa took Ashley to dentist, broken tooth. Taxes amended. Lesa got kids. Note from Mrs. Dillman, Bruce won&amp;#8217;t listen. Dillan decided he didn&amp;#8217;t need to bring homework home, we decided he didn&amp;#8217;t need to go to Scouts, took Dwyane, signed him up, Ashley went too, played on playground.</description>

Book bags ready, kids are too. I won&amp;#8217;t be able to go with Bruce to kindergarten tomorrow, Lesa is going.</description>

      <description>Tough getting ready for daycare. Started job, overwhelmed, excited, apprehensive, better than last job, only first day. Work at 9am, off at 5pm, Lesa picked up kids. Took taxes to H&amp;amp;R Block, ADP mistake, Schurz under-withheld on paycheck. Lowe&amp;#8217;s for thermostat. Tough bedtime too.</description>

Ashley and Dwyane to doctor, asked Ashley if she had hair down there, OMG, apparently she&amp;#8217;s old enough, OMG! Kids swam at Jessica&amp;#8217;s. Taste of India for lunch with Lesa. Errands galore. Pizza, TV.</description>

      <description>At the doctor office Dwyane said: Daddy, Ashley is trying to play with this and I was here first! Dave: Dwyane, if some little girl you didn’t know came up and started playing with that would you share, or would you tell me some little girl wanted to play with that but you were there first? Dwyane: I’d share. Dave: Then why won’t you share with Ashley? Dwyane: Ashley’s a big girl &amp;#8211; not little.</description>

      <description>Calling it my last work day, turned in keys/access card, wiped email/files on PC, removed traces of work from phone! Feels good, apprehensive for Monday. Kids went to Jessica&amp;#8217;s to swim, Dillan in trouble for popping blow-up duck float. Last night of swim lessons, everyone passed!</description>

      <description>Work at 9, today reminded me why I&amp;#8217;m quitting Schurz, Michelle has lost her mind! Another cold, rainy day. Kids did okay at daycare, I think they&amp;#8217;d be happier at school. Realized I have to work on Bruce&amp;#8217;s first day of kindergarten, so disappointed! Lesa took kids to swim lessons.</description>

      <description>Hi Daniel and Nicolle,
We had a good year. We took a vacation to Kentucky, went on a paddleboat ride on the Ohio and went to the Newport Aquarium. We went to the Children&amp;#8217;s Museum. Monster Jam in February was huge. We&amp;#8217;ve been to basketball, soccer, and baseball games. We&amp;#8217;ve been boating on Monroe Reservoir, ice skating, roller skating, several festivals including IU&amp;#8217;s STEM festival, bowling, to movies and a drive-in theatre.</description>

      <description>Lesa still sick. Took Pleasant to vet, it was time to put her down, kids took it well. I took kids to the Pinewook Derby races, Dillan placed 1st, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st again, he was very pleased with car. Spent afternoon burying Pleasant in the sleet and snow. Bruce is getting sick.</description>

      <description>Lots of snow, 2-hr delay, let kids sleep extra hour. Horrible workday, would get another job if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for the money &amp;#8211; working for family. Lesa took online class from home. Kroger for Dwyane&amp;#8217;s milk, picked up kids at 5:25p, just made it! Dillan struggling with math. I&amp;#8217;m tired.</description>

      <description>Tooth fairy came for Dillan. No school again! We worked, kids at daycare. Kids were so bored: watched movies and played Wii, games, toys &amp;#8211; boring! At home acted like crazy kids, full of energy. Dwyane still coughing. Put kids to bed early. I spent night doing Pablo diary entries.</description>

      <description>Thursday, January 11, 2018 {.text-right} Dear Diary,
I got to go home with Dwyane tonight. I was so excited to see my old friends Dillan and Ashley and their brother Bruce! They’ve all gotten so big since the last time I saw them!
And now they’re a real family because Dwyane’s mom and dad, Lesa and Dave, adopted all four of them last summer. Dwyane was telling me all about it.</description>

      <description>Better workday. Raining, 50&amp;#8217;s, ice storm/snow forecast tonight/tomorrow. School closed already, daycare delayed, kids excited, hoping for snow to go sledding. Dillan and Ashley both met AR Reading goals, awarded with AR party, ice cream sundaes, prizes. Dwyane brought home Pablo.</description>

      <description>The boys woke up before light and were in their room playing with the door closed. Lesa saw the bathroom light was on and turned it off. The boys noticed the bathroom light wasn&amp;#8217;t shining under their door anymore and it got really quiet in their room. Then Lesa heard Dwyane say: Remember, God is with you, God is with you. Then the door cracked open, and Bruce slowly stuck his head out the door.</description>

      <description>Dillan, on the way to Scouts: Daddy, I love and like you. Dave: I love and like you too. Dillan: You&amp;#8217;re the best. Dave: Well, thanks Dillan. A lot of kids probably think their dad is the best. They can&amp;#8217;t all be the best. I&amp;#8217;m probably just an okay dad. Dillan: No, you are the best. That&amp;#8217;s my opinion. Dave: Thanks Dillan! Dillan: Do you know why you&amp;#8217;re the best? Dave: No, why?</description>

Ashley: Yeah, but you don&amp;#8217;t know what kind. Dave: Well, okay. Speaking of Christmas, what should we get Mommy? Dillan and Ashley both shouted: JEWELRY! Bruce: A ring with a big sparkly thing on it. Dave: Besides jewelry what can we get her? Bruce: Peace and quiet!</description>

      <description>Coming home from church Ashley must have said at least ten times: Daddy, Dwyane did &amp;#8230; [insert some perceived wrong]. Dwyane countered each and every one of Ashley&amp;#8217;s claims by saying: Daddy, Ashley did &amp;#8230; [insert some perceived wrong] &amp;#8230; too. And she did it first! Bruce: Daddy? Dave: What Bruce? Are you going to tattle tale on someone too? Bruce: No! Dillan quickly said: I will! Dave: So Bruce, what were you going to say?</description>

Bruce: That&amp;#8217;s because of all the bugs. Dave: The world is full of bugs. There are even bugs in the house. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t let bugs stop me from having fun. Bruce: But these are outside bugs like spiders, grasshoppers, lizards, butterflies, and bees. Ashley: Butterflies aren&amp;#8217;t bad. Dave: Lizards aren&amp;#8217;t bad either, or bees, or grasshoppers.</description>

      <description>Dave: Bruce, go get your bike. Bruce: But a coyote might eat me.. Dave: No, you won&amp;#8217;t be eaten. Coyotes don&amp;#8217;t usually eat people. Bruce: They like meat and I&amp;#8217;m meat! Dave: You make a good point there but I think you&amp;#8217;ll be okay. Dwyane: They won&amp;#8221;t eat you that fast cause you&amp;#8217;re too big. They will only eat a leg or something. Dave: Right, I bet he feels better now.</description>

We went to their house and had a bonfire a little while ago. They have the cows. Bruce: Oh yeah, I remember them. Are they bringing the cows too? Dave: Maybe, but the cows&amp;#8217;ll have to stay on the deck. They can&amp;#8217;t come in the house. Ashley: Those cows were the sneaky kind of cows.</description>

      <description>Ashley, telling me all about the bad things that have happened to her: Daddy, I&amp;#8217;ve been hit in the face by four different kinds of balls. One was the squishy kind at gym, and it hurt. And I&amp;#8217;ve wrecked on my bike. And I&amp;#8217;ve been hit with [toy] cars and [toy] trucks, and I&amp;#8217;ve been kicked and hit and pinched by all the boys, and I was pushed off the bed and snapped my neck, and I&amp;#8217;ve been pushed down the stairs and fell down the stairs too.</description>

      <description>Bruce: Daddy, a leaf just hit your window. Dave: What! Of all the &amp;#8230;! How dare that leaf hit my truck! Some nerve! I&amp;#8217;m going back right now and spankling that leaf! Bruce: But Daddy, you&amp;#8217;ll break that leaf in half. Dwyane: That leaf is probably a stick and a stick won&amp;#8217;t break in half. Dillan: That leaf would probably deserve it. Going around and hitting peoples trucks isn&amp;#8217;t good. Ashley: You&amp;#8217;ll never catch that leaf.</description>

Bruce: The beehives the doctor gave us the yucky medicine for. Dave: Oh, you mean the hives. Bruce: Yeah, the beehives. Dave: No, it&amp;#8217;s not the hives this time. It kind of looks like you hit something. Bruce: Yeah, I hit my nose on the steps. Dave: No, you did that last night.</description>

      <description>Dillan: Daddy, would a school bus squash your truck? Dave: Yup, it would certainly make a mess. Dillan: Would it kill us? Dave: Maybe could. Dillan: That bus was on our side, that&amp;#8217;s dangerous. Dave: Yup, but you notice I gave it all the room I could. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to hit a school bus. Dillan: Cause it&amp;#8217;d squash us? Ashley: Because of the children. Dave: Exactly Ashley. And I don&amp;#8217;t want squashed.</description>

      <description>Open Arms Christian Ministries
News &amp; Media  We are Dave and Lesa Williams. We worked with youth as Sunday School teachers but have no biological children. We attended an Open Arms presentation at church and a few years later we were licensed. We both work full time, thought school age a good fit, so we requested one child five or older. Awaiting our first placement, we respited a sibling group of four: Dillan 4, Ashley 3, Dwyane 19m, and Bruce 7m.</description>

      <description>Dwyane: These shoes are tight. Dave: Are they getting small? Dwyane: No, my feet are getting big. I like when they&amp;#8217;re tight cause they don&amp;#8217;t fall off. Dave: Ah, makes sense. Lesa: I just checked those shoes! They&amp;#8217;re not too small, they fit perfect. </description>

      <description>Golden Slumber Melody by the Beatles played on the radio and I turned it up. You know which part. Afterward I said: I grew up listening to that kind of music. Dillan: I liked it too Daddy. Dwyane: I was playing [air] guitar on my belly! Ashley: What was that music? Dave: It was a band called The Beatles. Dillan: I think I saw a picture of them once. Ashley, not to be outdone: I saw two beetles in my room one time!</description>

Bruce: What goes on her ears. Dave: You mean earrings. Bruce: Yeah, they&amp;#8217;ll last until fireworks time! Dwyane: Yeah, I think Mommy needs rings.</description>

      <description>Hi. This is my first time writing something like this and I hope I do a good job describing the kids for you. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a clue what to write so Lesa and I jotted down things that came to mind. Then we listed some activities they&amp;#8217;ve done as individuals and with us as a family. Then I tried to organize those in a meaningful way and tried to fill in blanks and add details.</description>

      <description>December 22, 2016
Dear David and Lesa Williams,
I was touched to receive your letter last night. First, I would like to personally thank you both for taking
in and caring for Daniel&amp;#8217;s babies. As a single mother, I know how difficult and yet how rewarding raising
children can be. I felt extreme guilt for not being able to take them in myself, but my prayers were
answered, when a lovely couple, such as yourselves, were willing to keep the kids together.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m passing this along to you.
Stephanie Helton, FCM &amp;#8211; Martin Co.
&amp;nbsp;
 Good Morning,
Ms. Hulsey requested that I provide the namesakes for the children to you so that you can provide it to the foster/adoptive parents.
&amp;nbsp;
 Dillan Levi &amp;#8211; I choose Dillan&amp;#8217;s first name the day he was born, the moment I saw his face the name came to me. I picked Levi as his middle name after a dear family friend who had passed, Dustin Levi Kelley.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone I&amp;#8217;m so sorry that you all are going through this horrible tragedy. But I thought I was alone. I never wish the pain that I feel in my whole body on anyone in the world. Not even the caseworker that has led me down this road. I have (had) four beautiful babies and coming up in the beginning of July I&amp;#8217;m signing my rights over. I have not gotten to speak or see my babies since 2014 my youngest was 6 months old then.</description>

      <description>Ashley, at dinner: Maybe some husbands could cook so little girls&amp;#8217; mommies can play with them because they only have brothers and no other girls to play with? Ashley: Or maybe some other girl who&amp;#8217;s mommy and daddy doesn&amp;#8217;t take care of her and be nice to her can find nice people to take care of her. And then those nice people can take one of the boys [she looks at Dillan] and send to other nice people and then it would be even &amp;#8211; two girls and two boys.</description>

      <description>Dear Diary,
Tonight I stayed with my new friend Ashley Moffett. I remember her from last year when I stayed with her older brother Dillan. I was very happy to see my old friend again and to make another new friend! God has blessed me so much! I met some of Ashley&amp;#8217;s friends while we waited for her daddy to pick us up. He bought 113 liters of gas for his truck and then we went to Ashley&amp;#8217;s house!</description>

      <description>[The kids are always trying to &amp;#8220;scare&amp;#8221; me and don&amp;#8217;t understand how it is that I&amp;#8217;m not scared. I always tell them those kinds of things don&amp;#8217;t scare me. Then I tell them something bad happening to Lesa or them is what scares me; like getting hurt, or being really sick, or not getting to stay with us. Then last Wednesday Ashley fell from the monkey bars at school and bit her lip and had a bloody nose.</description>

Dave: No, I&amp;#8217;m not putting you on top. You might die. Ashley: Okay Daddy. Daddy? Dave: What?</description>

Mom-my Le-sa is so pret-ty.
Mom-my Le-sa is so pret-ty.
I love and like Mom-my Lesa. Dad-dy Dave is so pret-ty.
I mean Dad-dy Dave is so hand-some.
Dad-dy Dave is so hand-some.
Dwyane-y and Bruce-y and Dad-dy Dave is so hand-some.
Dad-dy Dave is hand-some-est cause he is gray.
I love and like Dad-dy Dave. Daddy? Do you like my new song? </description>
