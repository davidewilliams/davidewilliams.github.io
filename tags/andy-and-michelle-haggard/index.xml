      <description>Lesa and I both poor night&amp;#8217;s rest, dragged all day, Lesa home early, thankfully she doesn&amp;#8217;t seem as sick as me &amp;#8211; at least not yet. Yesterday, I messaged Andy and Michelle Haggard, former foster parents first removal; I got reply back and lots of pictures, speechless. God is good. </description>
