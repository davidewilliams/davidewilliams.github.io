      <description>Dillan and Ashley rode bus, took Dwyane and Bruce to school, didn&amp;#8217;t want Bruce to carry Pablo. Long, but productive workday; tired. Kids sledded on ice, all got hurt pretty much immediately. Dillan brought home stack of papers with good grades, proud! Took Ashley to piano lesson.</description>

      <description>Caught bus to school, kids didn&amp;#8217;t want to go, can&amp;#8217;t blame them, I didn&amp;#8217;t want to work. Ashley getting sick, sore throat, runny nose. Got kids from daycare, Pablo came home with Bruce, he knows it&amp;#8217;s a stuffed bear, had fun with it anyway. Skipped Scouts. Marriage Oneness homework.</description>

      <description>Tooth fairy came for Dillan. No school again! We worked, kids at daycare. Kids were so bored: watched movies and played Wii, games, toys &amp;#8211; boring! At home acted like crazy kids, full of energy. Dwyane still coughing. Put kids to bed early. I spent night doing Pablo diary entries.</description>

      <description>Better workday. Raining, 50&amp;#8217;s, ice storm/snow forecast tonight/tomorrow. School closed already, daycare delayed, kids excited, hoping for snow to go sledding. Dillan and Ashley both met AR Reading goals, awarded with AR party, ice cream sundaes, prizes. Dwyane brought home Pablo.</description>

      <description>Another 2-hr school delay; more sub-zero temps/wind chills. While confirming CFTM tomorrow I learned it had been rescheduled at Nicolle&amp;#8217;s request; I got pissed because I wasn&amp;#8217;t notified. Pablo Bear visited from Mexico City tonight; spent the evening with Ashley; lots of pictures!</description>

      <description>[Pablo is a teddy bear that lives in Mexico. He stayed the night with Dillan and each of his kindergarten classmates last year. Some of Pablo&amp;#8217;s travels were discussed in class.] Dillan: Daddy, do you remember Pablo? Dave: Yeah. Dillan: I sure miss him. I hope he comes back to visit with Ashley someday. </description>
