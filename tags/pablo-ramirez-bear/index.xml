      <description>Dillan and Ashley rode bus, took Dwyane and Bruce to school, didn&amp;#8217;t want Bruce to carry Pablo. Long, but productive workday; tired. Kids sledded on ice, all got hurt pretty much immediately. Dillan brought home stack of papers with good grades, proud! Took Ashley to piano lesson.</description>

      <description>Caught bus to school, kids didn&amp;#8217;t want to go, can&amp;#8217;t blame them, I didn&amp;#8217;t want to work. Ashley getting sick, sore throat, runny nose. Got kids from daycare, Pablo came home with Bruce, he knows it&amp;#8217;s a stuffed bear, had fun with it anyway. Skipped Scouts. Marriage Oneness homework.</description>

      <description>1-14-19 Dear Diary,
I got to go home with Bruce Williams. His mom and dad were so excited to see me again and I was excited to see Dillan, Ashley, and Dwyane again. Even the dogs remembered me! It is a little sad that tonight might be the last time at Bruce&amp;#8217;s house.
One of the first things Bruce and I did was go sledding down the hill. Then we ate dinner and I sat at the table next to Bruce and his mom.</description>

      <description>Tooth fairy came for Dillan. No school again! We worked, kids at daycare. Kids were so bored: watched movies and played Wii, games, toys &amp;#8211; boring! At home acted like crazy kids, full of energy. Dwyane still coughing. Put kids to bed early. I spent night doing Pablo diary entries.</description>

      <description>Thursday, January 11, 2018 {.text-right} Dear Diary,
I got to go home with Dwyane tonight. I was so excited to see my old friends Dillan and Ashley and their brother Bruce! They’ve all gotten so big since the last time I saw them!
And now they’re a real family because Dwyane’s mom and dad, Lesa and Dave, adopted all four of them last summer. Dwyane was telling me all about it.</description>

      <description>Better workday. Raining, 50&amp;#8217;s, ice storm/snow forecast tonight/tomorrow. School closed already, daycare delayed, kids excited, hoping for snow to go sledding. Dillan and Ashley both met AR Reading goals, awarded with AR party, ice cream sundaes, prizes. Dwyane brought home Pablo.</description>

      <description>Another 2-hr school delay; more sub-zero temps/wind chills. While confirming CFTM tomorrow I learned it had been rescheduled at Nicolle&amp;#8217;s request; I got pissed because I wasn&amp;#8217;t notified. Pablo Bear visited from Mexico City tonight; spent the evening with Ashley; lots of pictures!</description>

      <description>Dear Diary,
Tonight I stayed with my new friend Ashley Moffett. I remember her from last year when I stayed with her older brother Dillan. I was very happy to see my old friend again and to make another new friend! God has blessed me so much! I met some of Ashley&amp;#8217;s friends while we waited for her daddy to pick us up. He bought 113 liters of gas for his truck and then we went to Ashley&amp;#8217;s house!</description>

      <description>[Pablo is a teddy bear that lives in Mexico. He stayed the night with Dillan and each of his kindergarten classmates last year. Some of Pablo&amp;#8217;s travels were discussed in class.] Dillan: Daddy, do you remember Pablo? Dave: Yeah. Dillan: I sure miss him. I hope he comes back to visit with Ashley someday. </description>
