      <description>Thanksgiving Day! Indy to Ave and Emily&amp;#8217;s for dinner, I stopped at work for 20 minutes on way. Made record time since Hwy 69 is mostly open. Kids had great time, loved playing with cousins, they like having family. Lesa and I enjoyed ourselves as well. So much to be thankful for!</description>
