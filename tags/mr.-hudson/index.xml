      <description>I&amp;#8217;m officially sick, long work day but I made it. Mr. Hudson talked to Bruce about yesterday, he cried and told Maddy he was sorry. Small stray terrier chased chickens, they scattered into woods, took us over an hour to round them up. Dillan hasn&amp;#8217;t been bringing school work home.</description>
