      <description>Family Sunday in sanctuary, Tony let go, church in shock. Snow came, not near amount forecast, thankful. I took Ashley to Kroger on S. Walnut to sell cookies, at 434, only 16 away from next goal. Boys sledded. Ashley not 100% but did okay. Dillan had issues getting homework done.</description>

      <description>Friday, long week! About 70%, upper lip split while sleeping, nose bleeds off and on. Slow getting ready, took kids to school. Work seems like big hole. Left work on time, stopped at Stinson&amp;#8217;s for Marriage Oneness DVD then picked up kids. Pizza, watched Hotel Transylvania 2, bed.</description>

      <description>Ashley: Did you learn anything at your Marriage Oneness Class? Dave: Yeah, we learned that kids take up all our time, and energy, and money. Ashley: I think you already knew that. Dave: Yes we did. Dwyane: Tony confirmed it for you? Dave: Yup! </description>
