      <description>Woke up to kids screaming and putting their hands on each other &amp;#8211; idiot, stupid, butt head, etc. Grounded all of them from screens of all types for entire weekend: no TV, tablets, phones, YouTube on computer, clock on microwave, etc. It was like we sentenced them to hell judging by all the wails, moans and groans we received. Went to Rural King and bought Ashley&amp;#8217;s pet play area, would be great for chickens, will be used for rabbits.</description>

      <description>Slept in, kids sitting quietly in living room, first time ever. Ashley bridged from Brownie to Junior, it was nice. Boys rode bikes and played while Lesa and Ashley ordered school cloths. Water main broke. Nicole&amp;#8217;s, slaughtered Ken Tussey&amp;#8217;s meat chickens. Tacos, TV, showers, bed.</description>

      <description>Lesa PTO, took Dillan to dentist. No cavities either. Rest of kids went to daycare, Dillan joined them, they went to Jessica&amp;#8217;s and swam. Logan Rogers picked on Ashley, Dwyane stuck up for her, good for him. Ate on the deck, nice. Helped Ashley clean rabbit hutch. Kids played, TV.</description>

      <description>Skipped church. Lowe&amp;#8217;s for OTR microwave. Built chicken carrier. Dillan had baseball practice, took Ashley, 2 hours long! Got hens from Nicole Rogers; made deal for baby rabbits, hutch for Ashley; pick up in 5 weeks. Installed microwave. Dillan ran away for 15 minutes, mad at me.</description>
