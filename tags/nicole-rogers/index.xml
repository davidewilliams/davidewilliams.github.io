      <description>Lesa PTO, took Dillan to dentist. No cavities either. Rest of kids went to daycare, Dillan joined them, they went to Jessica&amp;#8217;s and swam. Logan Rogers picked on Ashley, Dwyane stuck up for her, good for him. Ate on the deck, nice. Helped Ashley clean rabbit hutch. Kids played, TV.</description>

      <description>Skipped church. Lowe&amp;#8217;s for OTR microwave. Built chicken carrier. Dillan had baseball practice, took Ashley, 2 hours long! Got hens from Nicole Rogers; made deal for baby rabbits, hutch for Ashley; pick up in 5 weeks. Installed microwave. Dillan ran away for 15 minutes, mad at me.</description>
