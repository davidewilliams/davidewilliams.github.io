      <description>Daycare, kids swam at Jessica&amp;#8217;s. Ashley&amp;#8217;s face healing, looks bad, going to peel, hope it doesn&amp;#8217;t scar. Worked full day in Bloomington. Lesa took boys to swim lessons, I watched big kids. Dillan went to Gabe&amp;#8217;s, he wasn&amp;#8217;t home. Kids played Wii, let them watch Home Alone, up later.</description>

Planned on Asian Pearl, texted, Dillan getting home too late, settled on KFC. Dillan said he had good time, would go again, a win?</description>
