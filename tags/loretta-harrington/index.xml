      <description>Walked Bruce into school, talked with Mr Hudson. Worked at SAIC, one minute to spare picking up kids, almost took bad mood and headache out on kids but didn&amp;#8217;t. Took Ashley to piano lesson, she took test in her music book, Loretta scored it, gave her a B. Dwyane clipped his nails.</description>

      <description>Donated nickels to fight leukemia. Work okay, left at 4, picked up kids. Loretta called to cancel Ashley&amp;#8217;s piano lesson, had to work. Kids wound up, acting crazy; made them play outside, clean their rooms. Lesa helped kids with homework, she&amp;#8217;s a saint, especially with Dillan! TV.</description>
