      <description>Got Bruce&amp;#8217;s backpack, good grades also, Dillan our only worry. Drove to Fortville for annual Dellinger Dinner and Easter Egg Hunt, kids had lots of fun even though it rained all day. Went to my parents for Easter Dinner, everyone snacked since we just ate. Looked at three houses.</description>

      <description>Seems like kids fought all day. Lesa did eggs for &amp;#8220;Devil&amp;#8221; eggs, I took out three bags trash. Christmas at my mom and dad’s in Indy, kids had lots of fun playing with cousins. Yahtzee with kids, then by ourselves after kids&amp;#8217; bedtime. Marcy Cook texted about a villa in French Lick.</description>
