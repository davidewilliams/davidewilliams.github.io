      <description>Seems like kids fought all day. Lesa did eggs for &amp;#8220;Devil&amp;#8221; eggs, I took out three bags trash. Christmas at my mom and dad’s in Indy, kids had lots of fun playing with cousins. Yahtzee with kids, then by ourselves after kids&amp;#8217; bedtime.

      <description>No one even said &amp;#8220;Hi&amp;#8221; when I got up, missed Ashley&amp;#8217;s greeting. Church. Ashley home, had fun at Eleanor&amp;#8217;s. Lesa and Ashley went shopping. Boys watched Incredibles 2 again. Ashley cooked a meatloaf supper (Lesa helped). I teased Ashley, her feelings were hurt, it ruined my evening.</description>
