      <description>Ashley sick all night, threw up in bedroom, hallway, bathroom; spent an hour cleaning up. Lesa on vacation, wrapped gifts. Kids had school Christmas parties and gift exchanges, no complaints, must have been good. Hard keeping them calm, TV to rescue. Finished Rebecca PAVA letter. </description>

      <description>Hi Rebecca,
We received your letter of July 16.
We rented a PO Box from the United States Postal Service expressly for correspondence with Daniel and Nicolle. Clay Cummings, Daniel&amp;#8217;s lawyer at the time, alerted us to an issue. It appeared mail sent to it was either returned or lost. We have no idea what was sent or what we missed. We were unable to convince the USPS of the problem.</description>

      <description>Dear David and Lesa Williams,
July 16, 2018
I am the mother of Daniel Moffett. I received a letter from you a while ago and tried to respond a few
times since. Both letters I mailed to the P.O. Box address given to me in your letter. Both were returned
to me as undeliverable. I verified the address and tried again only to have that one returned as well. So</description>

Dear David and Lesa Williams,
I was touched to receive your letter last night. First, I would like to personally thank you both for taking
in and caring for Daniel&amp;#8217;s babies. As a single mother, I know how difficult and yet how rewarding raising
children can be. I felt extreme guilt for not being able to take them in myself, but my prayers were
answered, when a lovely couple, such as yourselves, were willing to keep the kids together.</description>
