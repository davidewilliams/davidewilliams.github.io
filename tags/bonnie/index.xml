      <description>Got Bruce&amp;#8217;s backpack, good grades also, Dillan our only worry. Drove to Fortville for annual Dellinger Dinner and Easter Egg Hunt, kids had lots of fun even though it rained all day. Went to my parents for Easter Dinner, everyone snacked since we just ate. Looked at three houses.</description>

      <description>Christmas! Santa came, left candy coal for Dillan but we added a few more gifts. Indy to Grandpa Avery and Grandma Bonnie&amp;#8217;s house after our Christmas morning. Kids got to played with lots of their cousins, had a great time! Memories. I felt sick going, during, on way back, still.</description>

      <description>Passed out all day. Missed McVay Family Reunion in Fortville, I would&amp;#8217;ve died, plus no need to get Bonnie and Ave sick. Lesa took kids to get mail, came back with Dillan&amp;#8217;s friend Gabe and sister Gracie. Lesa is a saint, watched kids entire day by herself, not easy for her. Slept!</description>
