      <description>Dear Children,
I love you guys so much I think of you everyday &amp;amp; night.
Are you guys going to be doing any Christmas carroling this
year? I know people would love to get visits from angels like
all of you. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you guys ever pay visits to any nursing
homes or elderly people, but they love the company. I talk to your
grandpa, my father, about twice a week, he is living in Florida</description>

      <description>Dear Dave &amp;amp; Lesa,
Hey how are you and the children? I am doing good.
It would be really nice to hear from you and the children.
I hope you are willing to allow the children to receive my
letters or will read to them what you feel is appropriate for them to
receive, as well as allowing them to contact me if they so choose.
If you do not feel as though it is appropriate for us to write each other</description>

      <description>Hi. This is my first time writing something like this and I hope I do a good job describing the kids for you. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a clue what to write so Lesa and I jotted down things that came to mind. Then we listed some activities they&amp;#8217;ve done as individuals and with us as a family. Then I tried to organize those in a meaningful way and tried to fill in blanks and add details.</description>

      <description>Dillan: Daddy? Dave: What? Dillan: Why do people keep giving us swimming pools? Dave: People give us things because they want to help us. Dillan: Why? Dave: People want to help us because they want to show God&amp;#8217;s love through them, and because they know how expensive and hard it must be to take care of four kids that aren&amp;#8217;t our kids yet, and because they want to make you kids feel better and have fun and not be sad.</description>
