      <description>Barely caught bus. Work slow, dropped taxes off afterward, Lesa picked up kids. Text message mail server down, didn&amp;#8217;t see a problem. Another text, Ashley punched classmate Seth in face, his mom called and complained. New hot water heater installed, here late, Dillan watched them.</description>

      <description>Barely made bus, Bruce no shoes, Dwyane playing with LEGOs in underwear come time to leave. Parent/teacher conferences, no big surprises except Ashley in Accelerated Program and didn&amp;#8217;t tell us. Annetta/Jessica watched kids, took to Pizza Hut with us, whose behaved kids are these?</description>

      <description>Kids ready early! Didn&amp;#8217;t do much at work until afternoon, Linux OS builds, and maps; two things I&amp;#8217;m interested in. Kids stuck inside at daycare, it rained. Canceled Ashley&amp;#8217;s piano lesson, teacher meet and greet instead: Mrs Dillman, Mrs. Wronowicz, Ms. Page, Mrs. Harp. Pizza Hut.</description>
