      <description>Skipped church, slept until 9:30! Dillan made me breakfast in bed. Kids wanted to sled in morning, didn&amp;#8217;t let them. Walmart, everyone needed shoes except Lesa. Sledded all afternoon, Lexi and Kash came up again, kids almost hurt themselves with frostbite. Dillan disrupted prayer.</description>
