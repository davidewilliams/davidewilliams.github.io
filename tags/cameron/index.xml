      <description>Left for Wisconsin early, thunderstorms and lunch in Illinois, rained off and on until Stevens Point, road construction entire way but we made good time, kids did good traveling but got bored last couple of hours. Merrill, family! Kids rode riding cars/bikes, swam. Rough bedtime.</description>
