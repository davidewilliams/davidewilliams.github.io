      <description>Barely made the bus, Kim waited for the kids to get on board. Took an alternate, scenic route to work, highway under construction and down to one lane. Spent most of day doing research. Lesa having her own problems at work. Both of us pretty zoned out by the time we get home. Mrs. Davis texted us, Dillan punched William in the eye and got in trouble for it. I was none to happy!</description>

      <description>Kids dressed/ready for school on time! Rode bus, Kim Thompson texted, Dwyane forgot backpack. Worked over. Got kids, sledded before supper; snow is melting, only ice left. Mrs Dillman needs photo of Bruce for newspaper weather. Mrs Harp let us know Dillan missing a lot of papers.</description>
