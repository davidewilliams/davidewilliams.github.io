      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Friday and Labor Day weekend, we get Monday off. Totally missed the bus, dropped kids off at school. Payday Friday, so I bought donuts for the shop per usual. Long, long day! Got off work at 3:00p and even gave them an extra hour. Took long leisurely drive through the countryside to pick up kids, truck started having transmission problems half way there, didn&amp;#8217;t want to pull or kick down into lower gear.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s great news, on Tuesday I had 5 year expectancy. Lesa took boys to last night of swim lessons, passed, party!</description>

      <description>Daycare, break in rain, swam at Jessica&amp;#8217;s. Boys crazy: up slide backwards, stacked riding toys, crashed Wriggly, busted his face. Ashley crazy too: four-finger scratched Elahdy&amp;#8217;s back, smarted off to Jessica. None listened. All kids got it once home! Stormed, ballgames cancelled.</description>

      <description>I was doing 60 mph in a 55 mph zone when I passed a patrol car going the opposite way, and said: Oh crap, I hope he doesn&amp;#8217;t turn around. All the kids turned their heads to look, and sure enough, the patrol car turned around, and headed back toward us. The kids yelled: He&amp;#8217;s turning around! Dave: He&amp;#8217;d better hurry or he won&amp;#8217;t see which way I&amp;#8217;m turning and he&amp;#8217;ll have to guess (as I made a left onto 54 toward Bloomfield).</description>
