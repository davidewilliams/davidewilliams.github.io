Dear David and Lesa Williams,
I was touched to receive your letter last night. First, I would like to personally thank you both for taking
in and caring for Daniel&amp;#8217;s babies. As a single mother, I know how difficult and yet how rewarding raising
children can be. I felt extreme guilt for not being able to take them in myself, but my prayers were
answered, when a lovely couple, such as yourselves, were willing to keep the kids together.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m passing this along to you.
Stephanie Helton, FCM &amp;#8211; Martin Co.
&amp;nbsp;
 Good Morning,
Ms. Hulsey requested that I provide the namesakes for the children to you so that you can provide it to the foster/adoptive parents.
&amp;nbsp;
 Dillan Levi &amp;#8211; I choose Dillan&amp;#8217;s first name the day he was born, the moment I saw his face the name came to me. I picked Levi as his middle name after a dear family friend who had passed, Dustin Levi Kelley.</description>
