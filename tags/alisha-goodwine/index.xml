      <description>Barely made the bus, Kim waited for the kids to get on board. Took an alternate, scenic route to work, highway under construction and down to one lane. Spent most of day doing research. Lesa having her own problems at work. Both of us pretty zoned out by the time we get home. Mrs. Davis texted us, Dillan punched William in the eye and got in trouble for it. I was none to happy!</description>

      <description>Lesa wants to make offer on house, I don&amp;#8217;t, so we won&amp;#8217;t. Bruce took field trip to quarry, he had fun. All baseball practices rained out. Scouts canceled, Amanda in hospital, pregnancy complications, Alisha Goodwine took over, Scouts after all, Lesa took her and boys, boys played.</description>
