      <description>I&amp;#8217;m officially sick, long work day but I made it. Mr. Hudson talked to Bruce about yesterday, he cried and told Maddy he was sorry. Small stray terrier chased chickens, they scattered into woods, took us over an hour to round them up. Dillan hasn&amp;#8217;t been bringing school work home.</description>

      <description>Rained this morning, kids stayed in truck until bus. Mrs. Dillman texted, Maddy Davis subbed for her, Bruce acted up: got verbal, physical, won&amp;#8217;t go to office, disrupted class &amp;#8211; I whipped him when we got home. I&amp;#8217;m getting sick, laid on couch all night, Dillan and Ashley coughing.</description>
