      <description>Glad it&amp;#8217;s Friday! Got off a bit late, picked up kids. Looked at home in Monroe Co. Kids liked, I didn&amp;#8217;t, not sure about Lesa. Kids played on school playground while waiting on Springville Store pizza. Talked to Dillan about Mrs Harp&amp;#8217;s note: failing Math/Reading. Watched Coco DVD.</description>

      <description>Kids dressed/ready for school on time! Rode bus, Kim Thompson texted, Dwyane forgot backpack. Worked over. Got kids, sledded before supper; snow is melting, only ice left. Mrs Dillman needs photo of Bruce for newspaper weather. Mrs Harp let us know Dillan missing a lot of papers.</description>

      <description>Dwyane threw up at 2:30am, seemed okay after that. Kids rode bus. School called, Dwyane not well, Lesa took him home. Mrs Harp texted me, Mr Hudson called Lesa, Dillan got in fight with 5th grader, has black eye. Picked up kids at daycare. Elf came, tree decorated. Bruce behaved.</description>

      <description>Barely made bus, Bruce no shoes, Dwyane playing with LEGOs in underwear come time to leave. Parent/teacher conferences, no big surprises except Ashley in Accelerated Program and didn&amp;#8217;t tell us. Annetta/Jessica watched kids, took to Pizza Hut with us, whose behaved kids are these?</description>

      <description>Normal morning/day. Lesa picked Dillan up, he was cut from team. Mrs. Harp has been sending extra math homework home with Dillan, claims he got C- in Math, we haven&amp;#8217;t confirmed. I got other kids. Lesa took Ashley to new Girl Scouts in Fayetteville, had good time. Boys took baths.</description>

      <description>Kids ready early! Didn&amp;#8217;t do much at work until afternoon, Linux OS builds, and maps; two things I&amp;#8217;m interested in. Kids stuck inside at daycare, it rained. Canceled Ashley&amp;#8217;s piano lesson, teacher meet and greet instead: Mrs Dillman, Mrs. Wronowicz, Ms. Page, Mrs. Harp. Pizza Hut.</description>
