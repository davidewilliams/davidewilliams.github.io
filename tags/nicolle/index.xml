      <description>Ashley: How come we don’t go to foster training anymore? Dave: Lesa and I got tired and decided to focus on taking care of you guys the best we can. Besides, we kind of don’t have the room for another foster kid. Ashley: When we get our new place and have the extra room maybe we can get a girl. I think it would be nice to have a girl around.</description>

      <description>Long, long day; finally finished working at 10:15pm. Emails from Nicolle asking about PAVA letter. Dillan in trouble at school, during art he got mad and in his notebook he had drawn 18 stick figures and wrote &amp;#8220;Everyone’s dead in school but Dillan.&amp;#8221; WTF‽ Talked with him, no clue. </description>

Pablo Bear visited from Mexico City tonight; spent the evening with Ashley; lots of pictures!</description>

      <description>Dillan: Daddy? Dave: What? Dillan: Why do people keep giving us swimming pools? Dave: People give us things because they want to help us. Dillan: Why? Dave: People want to help us because they want to show God&amp;#8217;s love through them, and because they know how expensive and hard it must be to take care of four kids that aren&amp;#8217;t our kids yet, and because they want to make you kids feel better and have fun and not be sad.</description>

      <description>[Dillan and I were sitting on the stairs at church. We were discussing why he was disruptive during Sunday School. He was biting his lower lip and his whole body was trembling. I could tell he wanted to tell me something but was afraid to. I put my arm around him to comfort him.] Dave: It&amp;#8217;s okay Dillan. You can tell me. It will be okay. [Dillan remained quite and just looked at me.</description>
