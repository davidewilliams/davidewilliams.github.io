      <description>Ashley: How come we don’t go to foster training anymore? Dave: Lesa and I got tired and decided to focus on taking care of you guys the best we can. Besides, we kind of don’t have the room for another foster kid. Ashley: When we get our new place and have the extra room maybe we can get a girl. I think it would be nice to have a girl around.</description>

      <description>Hi Rebecca,
We received your letter of July 16.
We rented a PO Box from the United States Postal Service expressly for correspondence with Daniel and Nicolle. Clay Cummings, Daniel&amp;#8217;s lawyer at the time, alerted us to an issue. It appeared mail sent to it was either returned or lost. We have no idea what was sent or what we missed. We were unable to convince the USPS of the problem.</description>

Swimming, even Lesa. Drove Ashley to Hilltop Camp, signed her in, said goodbyes, nervous but Marcy and Eleanor were there.</description>

      <description>Work trudging along. Realtor said majority of houses we like are gone, looking at two tomorrow. So far no repercussions from Dillan&amp;#8217;s behavior yesterday. Man walking toward school with shotgun caused school lock down. Ate at Asian Pearl. Nicolle emailed, she received PAVA letter. </description>

      <description>Long, long day; finally finished working at 10:15pm. Emails from Nicolle asking about PAVA letter. Dillan in trouble at school, during art he got mad and in his notebook he had drawn 18 stick figures and wrote &amp;#8220;Everyone’s dead in school but Dillan.&amp;#8221; WTF‽ Talked with him, no clue. </description>

      <description>Hi Daniel and Nicolle,
We had a good year. We took a vacation to Kentucky, went on a paddleboat ride on the Ohio and went to the Newport Aquarium. We went to the Children&amp;#8217;s Museum. Monster Jam in February was huge. We&amp;#8217;ve been to basketball, soccer, and baseball games. We&amp;#8217;ve been boating on Monroe Reservoir, ice skating, roller skating, several festivals including IU&amp;#8217;s STEM festival, bowling, to movies and a drive-in theatre.</description>

      <description>Open Arms Christian Ministries
News &amp; Media  We are Dave and Lesa Williams. We worked with youth as Sunday School teachers but have no biological children. We attended an Open Arms presentation at church and a few years later we were licensed. We both work full time, thought school age a good fit, so we requested one child five or older. Awaiting our first placement, we respited a sibling group of four: Dillan 4, Ashley 3, Dwyane 19m, and Bruce 7m.</description>

      <description>Hi. This is my first time writing something like this and I hope I do a good job describing the kids for you. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a clue what to write so Lesa and I jotted down things that came to mind. Then we listed some activities they&amp;#8217;ve done as individuals and with us as a family. Then I tried to organize those in a meaningful way and tried to fill in blanks and add details.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m passing this along to you.
Stephanie Helton, FCM &amp;#8211; Martin Co.
&amp;nbsp;
 Good Morning,
Ms. Hulsey requested that I provide the namesakes for the children to you so that you can provide it to the foster/adoptive parents.
&amp;nbsp;
 Dillan Levi &amp;#8211; I choose Dillan&amp;#8217;s first name the day he was born, the moment I saw his face the name came to me. I picked Levi as his middle name after a dear family friend who had passed, Dustin Levi Kelley.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone I&amp;#8217;m so sorry that you all are going through this horrible tragedy. But I thought I was alone. I never wish the pain that I feel in my whole body on anyone in the world. Not even the caseworker that has led me down this road. I have (had) four beautiful babies and coming up in the beginning of July I&amp;#8217;m signing my rights over. I have not gotten to speak or see my babies since 2014 my youngest was 6 months old then.</description>

Dave: People want to help us because they want to show God&amp;#8217;s love through them, and because they know how expensive and hard it must be to take care of four kids that aren&amp;#8217;t our kids yet, and because they want to make you kids feel better and have fun and not be sad.</description>
