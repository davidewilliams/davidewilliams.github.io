      <description>Hi. This is my first time writing something like this and I hope I do a good job describing the kids for you. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a clue what to write so Lesa and I jotted down things that came to mind. Then we listed some activities they&amp;#8217;ve done as individuals and with us as a family. Then I tried to organize those in a meaningful way and tried to fill in blanks and add details.</description>
