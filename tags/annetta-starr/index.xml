      <description>Everyone tired. Worked late. Annetta made Dillan write page of: I will lose my bad attitude; Bruce write page of: I will keep hands to myself; and Dwyane draw: a happy picture. Lesa unloading groceries when we got home, we helped her. Pizza and Turbo movie. Dillan went to Gabe&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>Took kids to daycare, went to work, worked 9 hours. Annetta took boys to Springville Park. Lesa off early for eye exam, picked up kids after. Boys played at Gabe&amp;#8217;s, I passed them on way home. Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes, veggies for dinner, kids gobbled it up. Scary TV show.</description>

      <description>Kids on Spring Break, stayed at daycare, sucks! Lesa stayed home. Worked. Got kids: talked to Annetta, Jenny, and Chandler about daycare closing; we&amp;#8217;re going to be in trouble! Salmon for supper. Rusty Nut can&amp;#8217;t work on Jeep for four weeks! Picked it up, took it to Tire &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; Wheel.</description>

      <description>Much better on time this morning. Texts from Annetta regards Bruce&amp;#8217;s behavior, don&amp;#8217;t know what to do, find new daycare, Kozy Kids? Miserable at work, full blown cold. Wanted to go to Walmart, Lesa needed me home to control kids. Reading and spelling with Ashley, math with Dillan.</description>

      <description>Friday! Short workday. Talked with Annetta for an hour about kids. Bruce called her poopyhead, hides from teachers, spits, and other. Ashley smarts off. Dillan gets mad, follows wrong crowd, when leading makes poor choices. Dwyane good as always. Pizza! Watched The Good Dinosaur.</description>

      <description>Much better day! Dwyane super proud of new Paw Patrol backpack. Annetta Starr dressed in Easter Bunny outfit when I picked kids up from daycare, Bruce afraid of big characters, won&amp;#8217;t go near! Rained off-and-on, kids stuck inside. Dillan tried to be loving, I can tell it&amp;#8217;s forced.</description>
