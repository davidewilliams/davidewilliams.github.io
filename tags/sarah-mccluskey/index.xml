      <description>Kids rode bus. Text from Jessica, Dwyane can&amp;#8217;t go to daycare because he left school sick yesterday. Left work early, picked up kids from school, went to daycare anyway to buy homemade cinnamon candy from Sarah McCluskey, beat Lesa home. Kept evening low key, gave kids rest break.</description>

      <description>24 hours no medication, almost healthy but not yet. Day dragged by. Bruce proud of himself, didn&amp;#8217;t get in trouble, ran to tell me, had me check messages, good kid! Two loaves of zucchini bread from Sarah McCluskey, not as good as Lesa&amp;#8217;s, very dry. Passed out on couch. Off to bed!</description>
