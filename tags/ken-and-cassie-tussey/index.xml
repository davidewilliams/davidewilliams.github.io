      <description>Skipped church, slept until 8, kids 10. Called to make Dillan come home after lunch. Kids played inside/out, lots of fighting, made tent in Ashley&amp;#8217;s room. Emma&amp;#8217;s birthday swim party at John Lowery, kids had fun: rock wall, slide, diving boards; cut short by storm. Nice cool down!</description>

      <description>Daycare and work. Lesa picked up boys, I picked up Ashley from Emma&amp;#8217;s. She obviously had fun, was extremely tired, a total wreck. When she got home she tried to crash, made her take shower, opted to skip dinner, went to bed. Boys played, Dillan followed me on bike as I cut grass.</description>

      <description>Big fight with Ashley, can&amp;#8217;t undo words. Kids at daycare. Rained all day. Picked up kids, Lesa had dinner ready and waiting so kids could go to VBS. Bruce and Ashley acted out, wouldn&amp;#8217;t listen, got their attention by threatening VBS, fireworks and tears! Relented. Met Emma there.</description>

Tried to nap, got 30-45 minutes in. Rainy afternoon, stormy evening. TV out, Youth Group canceled. Kids in bed on time!</description>

      <description>Went to see about house plans, think we&amp;#8217;ll build. Stopped at Ken and Cassie Tussey&amp;#8217;s, invited Emma to spend night in a couple of weeks, hay for rabbits. Worked on hutch with Ashley, didn&amp;#8217;t finish. Kids played on trampoline at Lexi&amp;#8217;s. Took kids to ride bikes in school parking lot.</description>
