      <description>Took Dillan to his first guitar lesson by Ken Tussey, Dillan didn&amp;rsquo;t offer much feedback. Picked up 6 fryers, fixed up brooder coop, Rural King for supplies. Got a little rain. Dillan played at Gabe&amp;rsquo;s. Everybody fighting, Lesa and Ashley going at it, I&amp;rsquo;m the bad guy always. Baths.</description>

Emma&amp;#8217;s birthday swim party at John Lowery, kids had fun: rock wall, slide, diving boards; cut short by storm. Nice cool down!</description>

      <description>Daycare and work. Lesa picked up boys, I picked up Ashley from Emma&amp;#8217;s. She obviously had fun, was extremely tired, a total wreck. When she got home she tried to crash, made her take shower, opted to skip dinner, went to bed. Boys played, Dillan followed me on bike as I cut grass.</description>

      <description>Big fight with Ashley, can&amp;#8217;t undo words. Kids at daycare. Rained all day. Picked up kids, Lesa had dinner ready and waiting so kids could go to VBS. Bruce and Ashley acted out, wouldn&amp;#8217;t listen, got their attention by threatening VBS, fireworks and tears! Relented. Met Emma there.</description>
