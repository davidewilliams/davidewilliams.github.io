      <description>School, daycare for kids. Work for Lesa and me. Kids obviously tired but handled it well. Fought like cats and dogs at breakfast, made them get down. Mrs Malone texted us to say Ashley is a doll and she enjoys having her in class. Ashley gave us massages. American Ninja Warriors.</description>

      <description>First day of 2019-2020 school year! Rode bus. Bruce 1st, Dwyane 2nd, Ashley 4th, Dillan 5th. Wow! Mrs Willis, Mrs Day, Mrs Malone, Mrs Davis. No homework, teachers/pupils getting to know each other. Little Starr&amp;#8217;s. They had good day, could tell they were tired. Rest of us worked.</description>
