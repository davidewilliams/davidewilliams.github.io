      <description>Dear, Dillan, Ashley, Dwyane &amp;amp; Daniel,
How are all of you doing this week? I hope
you have been okay. I often wonder if
you are happy or not. I have suffered
from depression my entire life and still do.
I fear I may have passed this on to you through
my actions, poor choices, and of course genetics.
I always tell myself if I get to hold you one</description>

I love you guys and I try to write you so you know that
I am always thanking [sic] of you and that I care.

I knew weather or not you have been getting my letters,
I&amp;#8217;m going to continue to write &amp;amp; just hope for the best.</description>

      <description>Dear kids,
When I wrote this it was two days before Thanksgiving, they are
giving us chicken breasts, mash potatoes &amp;amp; stuffing. A pretty good
meal considering. I miss you all so much, I know
it seems like forever but this will eventually only be a brief
moment in time. I will wait patiently for as long as it
takes in order to hold you in my arms again. I love you</description>

      <description>Dear Children,
I love you guys so much I think of you everyday &amp;amp; night.
Are you guys going to be doing any Christmas carroling this
year? I know people would love to get visits from angels like
all of you. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you guys ever pay visits to any nursing
homes or elderly people, but they love the company. I talk to your
grandpa, my father, about twice a week, he is living in Florida</description>

Hey cutie pies how are you all doing, hopefully good. I know
you must be excited about Holloween [sic] this week, remember to be safe &amp;amp; have fun.
Don&amp;#8217;t eat too much candy &amp;amp; make sure to brush your teeth, too much sugar
is bad for your teeth. They got us the new Lion King movie
yesterday. I haven&amp;#8217;t watched it yet but I plan on it today.</description>

Besides, we kind of don’t have the room for another foster kid. Ashley: When we get our new place and have the extra room maybe we can get a girl. I think it would be nice to have a girl around.</description>

      <description>Dear, David and Lisa.
This is Daniel.
This letter is long overdue, and the truth is I have been a little scared to write it.
There are so many things to say and ask, but I guess the best way is to take it one step at a time and start at the Beginning.
Thank you so much for everything you do, you have been a mericle for me and the children.</description>

      <description>Hi Rebecca,
We received your letter of July 16.
We rented a PO Box from the United States Postal Service expressly for correspondence with Daniel and Nicolle. Clay Cummings, Daniel&amp;#8217;s lawyer at the time, alerted us to an issue. It appeared mail sent to it was either returned or lost. We have no idea what was sent or what we missed. We were unable to convince the USPS of the problem.</description>

I am the mother of Daniel Moffett. I received a letter from you a while ago and tried to respond a few
times since. Both letters I mailed to the P.O. Box address given to me in your letter. Both were returned
to me as undeliverable. I verified the address and tried again only to have that one returned as well. So</description>

      <description>Hi Daniel and Nicolle,
We had a good year. We took a vacation to Kentucky, went on a paddleboat ride on the Ohio and went to the Newport Aquarium. We went to the Children&amp;#8217;s Museum. Monster Jam in February was huge. We&amp;#8217;ve been to basketball, soccer, and baseball games. We&amp;#8217;ve been boating on Monroe Reservoir, ice skating, roller skating, several festivals including IU&amp;#8217;s STEM festival, bowling, to movies and a drive-in theatre.</description>

      <description>Open Arms Christian Ministries
News &amp; Media  We are Dave and Lesa Williams. We worked with youth as Sunday School teachers but have no biological children. We attended an Open Arms presentation at church and a few years later we were licensed. We both work full time, thought school age a good fit, so we requested one child five or older. Awaiting our first placement, we respited a sibling group of four: Dillan 4, Ashley 3, Dwyane 19m, and Bruce 7m.</description>

      <description>Hi. This is my first time writing something like this and I hope I do a good job describing the kids for you. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a clue what to write so Lesa and I jotted down things that came to mind. Then we listed some activities they&amp;#8217;ve done as individuals and with us as a family. Then I tried to organize those in a meaningful way and tried to fill in blanks and add details.</description>

      <description>December 22, 2016
Dear David and Lesa Williams,
I was touched to receive your letter last night. First, I would like to personally thank you both for taking
in and caring for Daniel&amp;#8217;s babies. As a single mother, I know how difficult and yet how rewarding raising
children can be. I felt extreme guilt for not being able to take them in myself, but my prayers were
answered, when a lovely couple, such as yourselves, were willing to keep the kids together.</description>

Stephanie Helton, FCM &amp;#8211; Martin Co.
&amp;nbsp;
 Good Morning,
Ms. Hulsey requested that I provide the namesakes for the children to you so that you can provide it to the foster/adoptive parents.
&amp;nbsp;
 Dillan Levi &amp;#8211; I choose Dillan&amp;#8217;s first name the day he was born, the moment I saw his face the name came to me. I picked Levi as his middle name after a dear family friend who had passed, Dustin Levi Kelley.</description>
