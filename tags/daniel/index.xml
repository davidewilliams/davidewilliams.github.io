      <description>Back to school/work. Made appointment with H&amp;R Block. Picked up kids, lots of April Fools jokes. Took all kids to Scouts, Bruce/Lions cleaned park, Ashley helped, playground afterward. Picked up PO Box letter from Daniel, still incarcerated, Lesa and I kind of upset over content. </description>

      <description>Ashley: How come we don’t go to foster training anymore? Dave: Lesa and I got tired and decided to focus on taking care of you guys the best we can. Besides, we kind of don’t have the room for another foster kid. Ashley: When we get our new place and have the extra room maybe we can get a girl. I think it would be nice to have a girl around.</description>

      <description>Same old morning/workday/afternoon. Finished antibiotics, feel much better than a month ago, wish Lesa would get better too. Kids watched TV. Jordan finished PAVA pics, they&amp;#8217;re awesome! Backgrounds and Facebook immediately! Spent evening ordering for Nicolle, Daniel, and Rebecca. </description>

      <description>Dillan: Daddy? Dave: What? Dillan: Why do people keep giving us swimming pools? Dave: People give us things because they want to help us. Dillan: Why? Dave: People want to help us because they want to show God&amp;#8217;s love through them, and because they know how expensive and hard it must be to take care of four kids that aren&amp;#8217;t our kids yet, and because they want to make you kids feel better and have fun and not be sad.</description>

      <description>Ashley: My other mom and dad only fed us cereal and hot dogs. And Kathy fed us cereal and lots of stuff. And I like the stuff God feeds us. [Food from our garden.] And you feed us lots and lots of good stuff and I like it the best. </description>

      <description>[Dillan and I were sitting on the stairs at church. We were discussing why he was disruptive during Sunday School. He was biting his lower lip and his whole body was trembling. I could tell he wanted to tell me something but was afraid to. I put my arm around him to comfort him.] Dave: It&amp;#8217;s okay Dillan. You can tell me. It will be okay. [Dillan remained quite and just looked at me.</description>
