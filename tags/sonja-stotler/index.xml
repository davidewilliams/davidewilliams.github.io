      <description>What a long day! Packed 4 boxes of cookies around, 1 for daycare, 1 for school, 2 for my work. Dropped kids at school because of Ashley&amp;#8217;s cookies and Bruce&amp;#8217;s snacks and drinks. Took cookies to Sonja at HTO, felt a bit surreal. Picked up kids and took boys to Scouts. I&amp;#8217;m wore out!</description>

      <description>Work, school, daycare; 3-day work week, still glad for weekend! We both left early. I got kids; Lesa grocery shopped, picked up Papa John&amp;#8217;s. Sonja, son Brayden, friend Jose joined us for dinner. Boys watched movie, we played Yahtzee; everyone seemed to have fun, hope to do again.</description>

      <description>Holiday World! Couldn&amp;#8217;t find Sonja&amp;#8217;s free tickets, expensive getting in! Kids complained all day about everything but definitely had a great time! Mostly rides and wave pool. Ate at Fleig&amp;#8217;s Cafe in Ferinand (picked a place with lots of vehicles). Too much sun. Got home late, bed!</description>
