      <description>First day of 2019-2020 school year! Rode bus. Bruce 1st, Dwyane 2nd, Ashley 4th, Dillan 5th. Wow! Mrs Willis, Mrs Day, Mrs Malone, Mrs Davis. No homework, teachers/pupils getting to know each other. Little Starr&amp;#8217;s. They had good day, could tell they were tired. Rest of us worked.</description>

      <description>Worked late. I was going to get Dillan and Ashley, take Ashley to doctor&amp;#8217;s for cheer leading physical, then Scouts, take Dillan to baseball. Rained, so just Ashley, Lesa got boys. Waited forever at doctor. Snacks for Scouts, saw Mrs. Davis. Dropped Ashley off, Lesa picked her up.</description>
