      <description>Seems like kids fought all day. Lesa did eggs for &amp;#8220;Devil&amp;#8221; eggs, I took out three bags trash. Christmas at my mom and dad’s in Indy, kids had lots of fun playing with cousins. Yahtzee with kids, then by ourselves after kids&amp;#8217; bedtime. Marcy Cook texted about a villa in French Lick.</description>
