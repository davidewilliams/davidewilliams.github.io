      <description>Church. I baptized Ashley and Dillan! Praise God! How awesome is that‽ We took Kathy Mitchell and Paul and Andrea Fries to El Ranchero for lunch, we all had a great time! Fantastic Sams for kid haircuts. Bought Lesa bedroom suite/mattress at Living Room Center. Truck overheating.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m exhausted. Kids rode bus. Second try to deliver cookies to Kathy, success! Talked with her awhile. Late getting kids again, supper was ready. Ashley could remember her piano homework so totally unprepared for tonight&amp;#8217;s lesson, discussed dropping piano lessons with her. Windy!</description>

      <description>Kids rode bus. Started out warm, got cold and rainy as day went on. Tried to deliver Kathy Mitchell&amp;#8217;s cookies, no one home. Picked kids up later than usual because of, Lesa had dinner on table waiting. Boys had Cub Scouts. Ashley stayed home, did science project. Big kid showers.</description>
