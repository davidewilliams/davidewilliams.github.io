      <description>Everyone slept in a little bit. The kids were cracking up when I started reading some of the old kid quotes. Kids very rambunctious and Lesa decided they needed exercise so after lunch we took them to Milwaukee Trail and walked to Wilson Park and back, that solved that. Took them to Jiffy Treat and stopped for milk before heading home. Dillan helped me put away tent. Ashley took care of her rabbits.</description>

      <description>Woke up to Nerf gun fight in the house. Put a stop to that and started breakfast. Skipped church, everyone up too late, needed the sleep. Dillan and Gabe went to his house around 9, came back half-an-hour later with Gracie. All the kids had fun playing with each other even tough Lesa and I had our fill. They ate lunch with us and we sent them home. We discussed the night with Dillan and Ashley because we really didn&amp;#8217;t like some of the behavior we saw.</description>

      <description>Took Dillan to guitar lessons, not sure if he&amp;#8217;s learning anything but he seems to enjoy going, doesn&amp;#8217;t practice much. After lunch we all went with Lesa to get her hair cut at Fantastic Sams in Bedford and then went to Walmart to get Ashley some white tennis shoes for cheerleading. Let the kids get donuts too. Set up the tent for Dillan and Gabe, he&amp;#8217;s spending the night. Built a fire, we all joined in on marshmallows and S&amp;#8217;mores and hot dogs.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Friday and Labor Day weekend, we get Monday off. Totally missed the bus, dropped kids off at school. Payday Friday, so I bought donuts for the shop per usual. Long, long day! Got off work at 3:00p and even gave them an extra hour. Took long leisurely drive through the countryside to pick up kids, truck started having transmission problems half way there, didn&amp;#8217;t want to pull or kick down into lower gear.</description>

      <description>Barely made the bus, Kim waited for the kids to get on board. Took an alternate, scenic route to work, highway under construction and down to one lane. Spent most of day doing research. Lesa having her own problems at work. Both of us pretty zoned out by the time we get home. Mrs. Davis texted us, Dillan punched William in the eye and got in trouble for it. I was none to happy!</description>

      <description>Better at getting ready this morning, managed to get everything done, made bus easily. Scientia all day, got a crap load done even with build issues. Boys seemed ready to go home when I picked them up. Ashley had cheer practice, issues over her shoes not being good enough, learned movements to last weeks&amp;#8217; cheer, Lesa picked her up at school after practice. Dillan has brought his agenda home last two nights, did okay work for Dillan.</description>

      <description>Kids still tired after getting up, missed bus, dropped them off at school. Started workday at SAIC and went to Scientia mid-morning. Picked up kids late, they were making slime and got upset with me for coming so early. Ashley didn&amp;#8217;t take care of her rabbits until we got on her. She was having troubles, talked back to us a lot, got emotional a few times. Dillan had multiple meltdowns over doing his homework, cried, and general didn&amp;#8217;t want to do it, total drama.</description>

      <description>Monday. Rained all night, downpour sprung live trap, fixed chicks tarp in preparation of storms, and still made bus on time. Worked in Bloomington and then SAIC around noon for rest of the day. Got ECT sensor from NAPA, then picked up kids. Kids stuck inside, boys not too bad, Ashley a mess, meltdown on lack of friends, another because Lesa doesn&amp;#8217;t love her enough, thinks she gets into trouble for disrespecting when Dillan pees the bed, blah, blah, blah, drama!</description>

      <description>Slept in, skipped church, everyone needed the extra rest. Got a young opossum in the live trap; Dillan, Bruce and I released it near Springville Cemetery West. After lunch, we went to Mike Pearson&amp;#8217;s to discuss the house, going forward, Lesa is comfortable, more so than me. Kids took A/V ride down to Ken and Cassie&amp;#8217;s place, we picked them up there, they were getting A/V rides and checked out a cave on their property.</description>

      <description>Woke up to kids screaming and putting their hands on each other &amp;#8211; idiot, stupid, butt head, etc. Grounded all of them from screens of all types for entire weekend: no TV, tablets, phones, YouTube on computer, clock on microwave, etc. It was like we sentenced them to hell judging by all the wails, moans and groans we received. Went to Rural King and bought Ashley&amp;#8217;s pet play area, would be great for chickens, will be used for rabbits.</description>

      <description>Different not having Dillan and Ashley around. Took boys to daycare, fair going on, no pool trip. SAIC, insecure about job. Boys played fairly well together, Bruce still a bit of a pill. Let them stay up later than usual to watch TV. I&amp;#8217;m either really tired or eyes are going bad.</description>

      <description>Ashley: How come we don’t go to foster training anymore? Dave: Lesa and I got tired and decided to focus on taking care of you guys the best we can. Besides, we kind of don’t have the room for another foster kid. Ashley: When we get our new place and have the extra room maybe we can get a girl. I think it would be nice to have a girl around.</description>

      <description>Woke up tired! Kids wanted me to drive them to school, except Dillan, he rode bus, drove rest to school. Spent half day at East Gate (SAIC) in software and map meetings, guess that&amp;#8217;s good, new work on top of old. Picked up kids. Took Ashley to piano lessons. Watched SOTU address.</description>

      <description>What a long day! Packed 4 boxes of cookies around, 1 for daycare, 1 for school, 2 for my work. Dropped kids at school because of Ashley&amp;#8217;s cookies and Bruce&amp;#8217;s snacks and drinks. Took cookies to Sonja at HTO, felt a bit surreal. Picked up kids and took boys to Scouts. I&amp;#8217;m wore out!</description>

      <description>Fairly normal morning/day. Mrs Harp sent Dillan&amp;#8217;s report card home early, and a note: seven Fs, one B in Art, several failed assignments, plus 19 missing! I was livid, grounded him from playing! Scout Pack meeting, many awards, Ashley went too. Record-breaking deep freeze on way.</description>

      <description>I was doing 60 mph in a 55 mph zone when I passed a patrol car going the opposite way, and said: Oh crap, I hope he doesn&amp;#8217;t turn around. All the kids turned their heads to look, and sure enough, the patrol car turned around, and headed back toward us. The kids yelled: He&amp;#8217;s turning around! Dave: He&amp;#8217;d better hurry or he won&amp;#8217;t see which way I&amp;#8217;m turning and he&amp;#8217;ll have to guess (as I made a left onto 54 toward Bloomfield).</description>

After a short pause, Ashley said: Oh well, it’s not a perfect world. Dave: Yup, and people aren’t perfect either. After a much longer pause, Ashley said: I’m kind of glad the world isn’t perfect.

Worked on Bruce&amp;#8217;s cardboard car, my fourth and last one, not going to miss it. Kids didn&amp;#8217;t want to go to bed but fell fast asleep.</description>

All kids went to daycare, afraid it&amp;#8217;ll be that way all week. Lesa transported all. Weather went from 90 to 30 like it saw a state trooper.</description>

      <description>Slept until noon! Mitchell Pool closed, went to John Lowrey Pool, had a blast. Dillan chatted up by 12-year-old who thought he was cute, she followed him up the slide, we&amp;#8217;re in trouble with such cute kids! Went to Orange Leaf. Grilled salmon. Bruce got a big splinter in his heel.</description>

      <description>Family Church, served communion. Kids played at Gabe&amp;#8217;s all afternoon, Ashley came home early; then Bruce, covered in mud; followed by Dwyane, muddy; finally Dillan, caked in mud. Dillan also scraped up and cut foot. Took everyone to see IU Men&amp;#8217;s Soccer game. Little Caesars Pizza.</description>

      <description>Slept in just a bit. Kids played on tablets after doing chores. After lunch took family to Scientia LLC to tour my workplace. Then we walked three miles of Karst Trail, slight sprinkle, never heard kids complain so much! Lesa wanted a much needed break, she opted for Asian Pearl.</description>

      <description>Can&amp;#8217;t believe I made it the entire week! Hopefully I can recover some over the 3-day weekend. Was going to go to zoo tomorrow but that&amp;#8217;s not happening! Won family-pak of tickets to IU Men&amp;#8217;s Soccer on Sunday, maybe can do that. Bruce good today, Lesa totally frazzled, others okay.</description>

      <description>24 hours no medication, almost healthy but not yet. Day dragged by. Bruce proud of himself, didn&amp;#8217;t get in trouble, ran to tell me, had me check messages, good kid! Two loaves of zucchini bread from Sarah McCluskey, not as good as Lesa&amp;#8217;s, very dry. Passed out on couch. Off to bed!</description>

      <description>Downright miserable workday, left two hours early, went to Bedford walk-in clinic, no strep or mono or flu, some other viral-type infection. Picked up kids. Took Dillan and Dwyane to Scouts, popcorn sales kickoff party. Spoke with JOINT Services about Dillan&amp;#8217;s IEP, not too happy.</description>

      <description>Finally woke at 2am. Trouble keeping food and water in me, fever, dehydrated. Kids so sweet, sneaking kisses on my cheek and forehead, wishing I&amp;#8217;d get better, Ashley made get well card. Made it through church, unable to sleep more, finally able to eat and get water.

      <description>Passed out all day. Missed McVay Family Reunion in Fortville, I would&amp;#8217;ve died, plus no need to get Bonnie and Ave sick. Lesa took kids to get mail, came back with Dillan&amp;#8217;s friend Gabe and sister Gracie. Lesa is a saint, watched kids entire day by herself, not easy for her. Slept!</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m officially sick, long work day but I made it. Mr. Hudson talked to Bruce about yesterday, he cried and told Maddy he was sorry. Small stray terrier chased chickens, they scattered into woods, took us over an hour to round them up. Dillan hasn&amp;#8217;t been bringing school work home.</description>

      <description>Normal morning, unexceptional day. Boys tearing up toys, crashing them, had to go outside; Ashley spent an hour helping Jessica pick up toys; Jessica wants paid on Mondays, still no license. Ashley piano lessons, still doing okay. Lesa in bad mood, guessing she had rough at work.</description>

      <description>Calling it my last work day, turned in keys/access card, wiped email/files on PC, removed traces of work from phone! Feels good, apprehensive for Monday.

      <description>Work at 9, today reminded me why I&amp;#8217;m quitting Schurz, Michelle has lost her mind! Another cold, rainy day. Kids did okay at daycare, I think they&amp;#8217;d be happier at school. Realized I have to work on Bruce&amp;#8217;s first day of kindergarten, so disappointed! Lesa took kids to swim lessons.</description>

Ashley had first phone call with Lilly McCluskey, she was so proud of herself, yesterday it was Justin Bieber&amp;#8217;s Baby song, growing up too fast! Swim lessons, boys doing great, Ashley in deep end diving.</description>

She has bad dreams like car wrecks and fires &amp;#8211; things that would keep us from coming back.] Ashley: Daddy, I&amp;#8217;m having those bad dreams again. Dave: Which ones? Ashley: The one where there&amp;#8217;s a fire and you and Mommy don&amp;#8217;t wake up and die and I&amp;#8217;m all alone.</description>

      <description>I avoided hitting a 6&amp;#8242; Black snake sunning itself on the road on our way home from camping and Bruce asked : Why is he laying in the road? Lesa: Because the road is the warmest place in the woods right now. He&amp;#8217;s cold blooded so when it&amp;#8217;s cold he get&amp;#8217;s cold. The road is warm so he gets warm. Dillan: Daddy, can snakes live in trees? Dave: Yes. Dillan: Can they live in caves?</description>

      <description>Kept busy all day, lots of work to do. Nice day, didn&amp;#8217;t get to enjoy any of it, upper 80s, seems really hot! Went to get kids when Lesa got home. They played and I worked some more. After supper kids played outside again, I adjusted swing chains to make them higher. TV and baths.</description>

      <description>Ashley: How come the boys want to be with Mommy the most? Dave: For some reason, daughters like their dads the most, and sons like their moms the most. Ashley: Did Mommy like her dad too? Dave: Mommy loves her dad but he is gone so she doesn&amp;#8217;t get to see and talk to him anymore. It&amp;#8217;s very sad. Ashley: She can still talk to him and he will hear her in Heaven.</description>

The boys noticed the bathroom light wasn&amp;#8217;t shining under their door anymore and it got really quiet in their room. Then Lesa heard Dwyane say: Remember, God is with you, God is with you. Then the door cracked open, and Bruce slowly stuck his head out the door.</description>

      <description>[Bruce was helping Lesa in the kitchen while she was cooking dinner. He helped with the eggs, then he wanted to help with something else. Bruce noticed that the plastic container drawer wasn&amp;#8217;t closed. Lesa told him it wouldn&amp;#8217;t close because the plastic containers needed to be organized. Bruce went ahead and organized it for Lesa! Wow! It closes now.] Then Lesa wanted to feed the chickens. She handed Bruce an ear of corn and asked him to shuck it (he&amp;#8217;s shucked corn before).</description>

      <description>Ashley, at dinner: Maybe some husbands could cook so little girls&amp;#8217; mommies can play with them because they only have brothers and no other girls to play with? Ashley: Or maybe some other girl who&amp;#8217;s mommy and daddy doesn&amp;#8217;t take care of her and be nice to her can find nice people to take care of her. And then those nice people can take one of the boys [she looks at Dillan] and send to other nice people and then it would be even &amp;#8211; two girls and two boys.</description>

      <description>[I have several good quotes to share and I will later. I have quotes certain to bring a smile and get lots of likes. I was going to pick from one of those this morning because it&amp;#8217;s a Monday and everyone needs a pick-me-up on a Monday morning. But I&amp;#8217;m not going to pick one of those, I&amp;#8217;m going to share this morning&amp;#8217;s breakfast talk instead. Here is the conversation between Ashley (5 years old) and Bruce (2 years old) while eating their Cheerios.</description>

      <description>[The kids are always trying to &amp;#8220;scare&amp;#8221; me and don&amp;#8217;t understand how it is that I&amp;#8217;m not scared. I always tell them those kinds of things don&amp;#8217;t scare me. Then I tell them something bad happening to Lesa or them is what scares me; like getting hurt, or being really sick, or not getting to stay with us. Then last Wednesday Ashley fell from the monkey bars at school and bit her lip and had a bloody nose.</description>

      <description>[Our rule making process goes something like this: We noticed sometimes people get down from the table to play or do other stuff and then they want to come back to the table and eat some more. We feel like we need a rule about getting down from the table while we&amp;#8217;re eating so we know when everyone is done and can start cleaning up dishes and stuff. We think that if people are going to be getting down from the table they must not be very hungry anymore, so maybe those people should be done eating; unless of course they got down to get more food or to go to the bathroom.</description>

      <description>[I stopped my Kid Quote of the Day status updates due to several reasons but mostly because I&amp;#8217;ve been too tired to even Facebook. However, there has been such an outcry over my decision I feel obligated to resume. Here is an appropriate one from this morning.] Dave to Dillan: Eat your cereal. Dillan: I&amp;#8217;m tired. Dave: I&amp;#8217;m tired too. So is Lesa. I think everyone is tired this week. Dillan: Yeah.</description>
