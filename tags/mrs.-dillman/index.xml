      <description>Lesa and I took kids to bus stop. Went to Bruce&amp;#8217;s Kindergarten Graduation, cupcakes/punch after, pictures with Mrs Dillman and Mr Hudson, glad he made it, proud of him, went home with Lesa. Worked late, made up time, Lesa got other kids from daycare. Dillan had Boy Scout meeting.</description>

      <description>Drove kids to school. Warm day. Leprechaun footprints around Bruce&amp;#8217;s trap, left a hat, no Leprechaun. Thought it was Thursday, was going to take Ashley to Scouts. Left earlier than usual to pick up kids and go home. Lesa went to CVS, got Mrs Dillman&amp;#8217;s photos, kids played outside.</description>

      <description>Kids dressed/ready for school on time! Rode bus, Kim Thompson texted, Dwyane forgot backpack. Worked over. Got kids, sledded before supper; snow is melting, only ice left. Mrs Dillman needs photo of Bruce for newspaper weather. Mrs Harp let us know Dillan missing a lot of papers.</description>

      <description>Bruce and Ashley had fevers, patched them up with Ibuprofen, sent them to school. Lesa off, ran errands. Mrs. Dillman sent Lesa note concerning Bruce&amp;#8217;s behavior, not so good. Got off work late, Lesa had to get kids. Dillan helped me put caliper on Suburban. Dwyane feels sick now.</description>

      <description>Better morning in every way. Pajama day at school. Bought three juicers from Mrs. Dillman for Ashley to give to Loretta for Christmas. Lesa got groceries and kids. Building maps at work, California-Mexico border for Marines, rush order, worked until 8:30pm, very long, tiring day!</description>

      <description>Barely made bus, Bruce no shoes, Dwyane playing with LEGOs in underwear come time to leave. Parent/teacher conferences, no big surprises except Ashley in Accelerated Program and didn&amp;#8217;t tell us. Annetta/Jessica watched kids, took to Pizza Hut with us, whose behaved kids are these?</description>

      <description>Sick as can be! Wanted to leave work early, no time built up. Fourth Friday Feast at work &amp;#8211; they provided lunch. Bruce in trouble again at school, this time Mrs. Dillman sent home a letter detailing issues. I passed out on couch, pretty much stayed there until 2am Sunday morning.</description>

      <description>Lesa took Ashley to dentist, broken tooth. Taxes amended. Lesa got kids. Note from Mrs. Dillman, Bruce won&amp;#8217;t listen. Dillan decided he didn&amp;#8217;t need to bring homework home, we decided he didn&amp;#8217;t need to go to Scouts, took Dwyane, signed him up, Ashley went too, played on playground.</description>

      <description>Kids ready early! Didn&amp;#8217;t do much at work until afternoon, Linux OS builds, and maps; two things I&amp;#8217;m interested in. Kids stuck inside at daycare, it rained. Canceled Ashley&amp;#8217;s piano lesson, teacher meet and greet instead: Mrs Dillman, Mrs. Wronowicz, Ms. Page, Mrs. Harp. Pizza Hut.</description>
