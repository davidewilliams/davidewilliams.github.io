<article class="blog-post">
    

<p>Hi. This is my first time writing something like this and I hope I do a good job describing the kids for you. I didn&#8217;t have a clue what to write so Lesa and I jotted down things that came to mind. Then we listed some activities they&#8217;ve done as individuals and with us as a family. Then I tried to organize those in a meaningful way and tried to fill in blanks and add details. Hopefully I end up with something that accurately describes the kids for you.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re a family in every sense of the word. There are very few residual effects related to foster care and adoption. Most of their anxiety has gone and they&#8217;re carefree and happy. That may change when they mature and begin to question and wonder about things. But for now, they are enjoying life, friends, school, church, and our time and activities together. The kids know and like both our extended families, and more importantly our families accept them as our kids. We love and treat them like we would our own kids. Being loved has helped them to heal. We try not to spoil them but sometimes we do. Our rules are simple: Love each other and don&#8217;t hurt yourself, each other, the animals, us, the house, or other people. We&#8217;ll work out the rest as it comes up. They have age-appropriate chores.</p>

<p>We try to do something different each week but that isn&#8217;t always possible. Sometimes we spend money, sometimes we go cheap. They&#8217;ve been to The Indianapolis Zoo, The Indianapolis Children&#8217;s Museum, a Monster Jam, Holiday World and Splashin&#8217; Safari, West Baden for a night at the hotel, and Wonder Lab. They&#8217;ve been to state parks, in caves, hiking, camping, fishing, shooting, bowling, skating, reservoir beaches, swimming, train rides, festivals, a couple of concerts including a bluegrass jam, on a jet plane, VBS, movies, a ballet, dancing and many activities more than once. Dillan wants to go on a fishing boat so I&#8217;ll borrow a friend&#8217;s and take him this summer. We like to eat out at different places and try to go at least once a month. We&#8217;ve done more things than we can remember or list.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve been to northern Wisconsin by vehicle twice so far and thus have seen a lot of Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. We&#8217;ve been to Indy more times than we can count. Now that we don&#8217;t need a court order to travel we&#8217;ll venture into nearby states for some activities. We flew to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida the first week of January. They had the best time. We didn&#8217;t do Disney as the beach was enough. We swam in the pool literally every day and went to the beach and swam in the ocean almost every day. The pool and beach was our home for the week. They&#8217;re young but none of them will ever forget going to Florida.</p>

<p>We teach them about Jesus. They&#8217;re being raised in an Independent Christian Church environment. New Testament Bible-based; one of the more popular denominations in Indiana. The kids love church. They have activities and friends. We tell them God knew they needed someone to take care of them and guided them to us, that he loves them and their biological family. We all pray together for you, healing, and peace and happiness in your lives. We teach them to forgive and to love others. Lesa and I are not perfect in living a Christian life, but it&#8217;s what we strive for in our lives, and it&#8217;s what we teach them.</p>

<p>We teach them life is short, so make the most of it, and to take advantage of opportunities when they arise. We try to expand their horizons, to let them see there are lots of things to do in the world besides TV and video games. We listen to all kinds of rock, country, Christian, bluegrass, jazz, blues, classical and anything else that shows talent. Dwyane has an interest in music. Ashley wants to play piano. A friend of ours will teach her when she&#8217;s older. We read a book of their choosing almost every night. We stress an education is important. We encourage and try to give them the confidence to be who they are.</p>

<p>Now, on to the children. I&#8217;ll start with Dillan and continue by age.</p>

<h3 id="dillan">Dillan</h3>

<p>He is in second grade and he&#8217;ll advance to third. Dillan likes school. He has only a few friends at school but they are good friends. Even though he likes school, he has trouble staying focused and doing his work. We&#8217;ve been working more with Dillan and he has brought his grades up to A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s. Most of his school issues revolve around talking when he shouldn&#8217;t and not listening to directions. In all though he is doing great at school and having a good time as well. He like school but dislikes homework. We need to keep him focused and encouraged so he continues to do well.</p>

<p>Last year he struggled with Math and Reading so over the summer we worked a lot with him, and with a tutor on Fridays, and this year he is doing much better. He likes reading, especially action stories like most boys, but he also liked a book about the Titanic sinking and he seems to like history in general. Dillan can be artistic when he wants. He had an art project that was selected from among his peers and it was featured on the wall of a local business for public display. It was a big thing and we celebrated his accomplishment with him.</p>

<p>Dillan has been a Scout since the first grade. During the winter months, we allow one activity outside of school per child so it doesn&#8217;t get to be too much and interfere with school work. As they mature that will change I&#8217;m sure. Dillan started as a Tiger, was a Wolf this year, and last week he earned the merit badges required to advance to Bear. He wants to continue with Scouting. Scouts is one of Dillan&#8217;s favorite activities. He&#8217;s been swimming, bowling, camping, hiking, fishing and shooting as part of Scout activities, and with us as well. He has been in a couple of parades, and has twice volunteered to visit nursing homes to sing carols at Christmas. He has built two Pinewood Derby cars and had a great time racing them each time. Dillan has a lot of friends in Scouts.</p>

<p>Another winter activity Dillan likes and is good at is ice skating. None of his peers at school have been ice skating yet so it&#8217;s something he can brag about. We went multiple times and he got better at it than us in a very short amount of time. Other winter activities he enjoys are sledding and snowman building, although there wasn&#8217;t near enough snow this winter; last winter was better.</p>

<p>During the summer, more activities take place. Dillan wanted to play baseball so we signed him up last summer and he enjoyed it so much he wanted to play again this year so we signed him up. He&#8217;s good with the mechanics of hitting and throwing but doesn&#8217;t have the game concepts down yet, but he&#8217;s only seven and that will come with time. Dillan has taken swim lessons for the past two summers and does okay but we&#8217;re going to sign him up again this summer. Almost every day that it doesn&#8217;t rain Dillan is in our pool at home. Swimming is high on his list of fun things to do.</p>

<p>He likes riding his bike a lot too. He&#8217;s been begging me to buy him an ATV or a dirt bike. He liked going to the Monster Jam and he likes to watch racing. He used to like pickup trucks until he discovered Mustangs. Now that&#8217;s his car of choice. He likes fast: fast cars, fast skating, fast running, fast swimming, fast anything.</p>

<p>Dillan is getting tall. He&#8217;s healthy, and rarely gets sick. He eats like a horse. He loves to eat. His favorite food is pizza. He&#8217;s only lost two teeth so far but the dentist said that&#8217;s about to change. He used to like yellow, then red, and now purple. He has a good imagination, and even though he won&#8217;t admit it, he loves his siblings. In fact, he&#8217;s loving in general. He loves us a lot, especially Lesa. He is kind and likes our animals. He is close to our dogs and cares a lot about them, especially the big one. He wants to please. He helps Lesa put up dishes or load the dish washer, he likes to haul trash with me and do guy things like work on cars and the house.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s mature enough to know about his situation and has figured out a lot of things all on his own. He has asked questions in the past and we&#8217;re transparent and open in an age appropriate way. He rarely asks us about any of you. If he does it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s trying to &#8220;organize&#8221; what happened in his mind. You can tell by the questions he asks. He mostly talks about his grandfather David if he talks about anyone. We teach them to love and forgive. We don&#8217;t speak against you but we won&#8217;t lie or cover for you either. Dillan has forgiven. He knows we adopted him, it&#8217;s not a secret. Dillan is happy we adopted him. He says he&#8217;s happy he has a family and won&#8217;t have to leave again. He&#8217;s happy to be with us. He likes and loves us. And he wants to live with us because he likes it here. He&#8217;s glad he doesn&#8217;t have to be anxious or worry about anything anymore. He trusts and knows we&#8217;ll take care of him no matter what.</p>

<p>He wanted to know what I was doing and I told him I was writing a letter to Daniel and Nicolle and then I asked him if he wanted me to tell you anything. His reply was &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221; I told him I probably won&#8217;t have an answer back for him. I cannot confuse him with the feelings a relationship with you would bring at his age, maybe when he&#8217;s older, and then only if he wants it. I only tell you because it shows the kind of heart he has and it shows he still cares about you.</p>

<p>He doesn&#8217;t have to watch over his siblings to make sure they&#8217;re okay anymore. He knows they are. Mostly Dillan is just being a kid, doing kid things. He&#8217;s enjoying being a kid. He&#8217;s playing with friends, he&#8217;s doing age-appropriate activities, he&#8217;s pure boy. He feels secure, he feels loved, he feels like he belongs in our family. We feel the same. He&#8217;s a happy and loving kid and we love him too. He&#8217;s going to be okay.</p>

<h3 id="ashley">Ashley</h3>

<p>Ashley is in first grade and will most definitely advance to second. Ashley is smart. She gets straight A&#8217;s in school. She loves to read. She reads everything, from cereal boxes, to road signs, to what I&#8217;m doing on the computer, just about anything, if it has words she tries to read it. She constantly amazes us with her ability to read and to comprehend as well. She knows she&#8217;s smart and at times she thinks she knows everything and sometimes she thinks she knows better than us. Ashley pretty much talks non-stop. I find it endearing, her siblings think it&#8217;s aggravating. She can be a drama queen at times.</p>

<p>Ashley is quick to make friends and is a social butterfly. Everyone likes her, and she has lots of friends, but her friendships are not as enduring as Dillan&#8217;s friendships are. She is a go-getter and will try new things with little hesitation &#8211; if we reassure her it&#8217;s okay first. She is outgoing and participates in activities at school such as labs and projects and extra credit and whatever. I can see her becoming a cheer leader, spelling bee contestant, science fair participant, school play, or some other type of thing. Ashley is also artistic and had a pinch pot selected from among her peers for display. Again, we celebrated with her.</p>

<p>Ashley is also a Daisy Scout. She enjoys scouting but not near as much as Dillan does. Girls Scouts don&#8217;t do anything exciting like Boy Scouts do. Ashley&#8217;s scout night is on a different night and she likes to go to Dillan&#8217;s scouts because they do more fun stuff. She likes excitement. Ashley enjoyed selling Girl Scout cookies, she&#8217;s been bowling, and hiking, and she was in a parade as well. She does have fun and wants to continue with scouting next fall. Two weeks ago, I took her on a father daughter square dance scouting event and we had a blast.</p>

<p>Other winter activities she likes is sledding and snowman building. She&#8217;s also the one most likely to start a snowball fight. Ashley is also good at ice skating. Not as fast as Dillan but better at turns and such. She likes to write and draw and do crafts. She has a journal, mostly with love notes to me, and drawings of her and me or her and our family. Her teacher gave her a book on cursive writing and she&#8217;s been teaching herself that. Impressive for a first grader.</p>

<p>In the summer, it&#8217;s the pool. She loves swimming. She has had swim lessons for the past two years also. She can swim on her own and is a stronger swimmer than Dillan. She will jump off the 10-foot diving board without hesitation and we often need to tell her to take a break and rest. We&#8217;ll sign her up again this summer. Last summer she wanted to take dance and she chose ballet and she liked it. Had a recital and everything. This year she wanted to play baseball like Dillan so we signed her up. So far she enjoys it.</p>

<p>Ashley also likes animals. She likes our dogs. She wants me to get her some rabbits. She likes our chickens and cats. She likes dinosaurs too. She asked Santa for a dinosaur book so she could learn more about them. She won&#8217;t pick a favorite color, says she likes the color rainbow. She likes lots of food but if she must pick, she picks spaghetti and meatballs. Good thing she likes spaghetti because she&#8217;s lost lots of teeth, many more than Dillan. So many the tooth fairy is going broke. Her adult teeth are coming in though. She&#8217;s cute even with missing teeth.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re confident she&#8217;ll be able to do whatever she desires in life but currently she just wants to be a mom. She has it planned in detail. A husband after going to college to be a vet and a teacher. Wants two kids, a boy and a girl. Says she&#8217;ll help kids like we did. Swears she&#8217;ll move us in with her and her husband when we get old so she can take care of us &#8211; we can stay on the couch. She has a loving, giving, and kind heart, and she loves her brothers (bubbies) immensely. She likes being their sister and tries to take care of them. She has a good imagination and plays mom with her dolls and her dollhouse, and has staged adoption hearings where she has adopted her dolls. I hope to live long enough to see her kids.</p>

<p>She completely loves and trust us. She gives us a love note every other day it seems. She will tell you she loves me and Lesa and God and Jesus in that order and then ask if it&#8217;s okay to love us more than God.</p>

<p>I asked her if she had anything she wanted to say and all she said was &#8220;Tell them I&#8217;m happy.&#8221; She hasn&#8217;t forgiven Daniel for hurting her. She doesn&#8217;t remember Nicolle&#8217;s name. She never talks about or asks about anyone. I doubt she remembers much. She&#8217;s been with us since she was three and that&#8217;s young. She has only ever said she thinks it&#8217;s sad that she won&#8217;t be able to see Evie until she is older. She doesn&#8217;t know anyone when I&#8217;ve shown her Facebook photos, including Evelyn. I&#8217;ve told her who&#8217;s who multiple times but she never remembers. As she gets older she&#8217;ll remember better and want to know more.</p>

<p>She was the most ecstatic about getting adopted. She has a dad and mom family; she&#8217;s loved and she loves us. I&#8217;m a king, Lesa a queen, Dillan and Dwyane and Bruce the princes and she&#8217;s a princess and her fairy tale story came true and she&#8217;s going to live happily ever after. She&#8217;s all girl but she certainly holds her own with her brothers. She loves dresses and frilly things and makeup and jewelry and so on. She&#8217;s a happy little girl with hardly a care in the world. She&#8217;s loved and she knows it and that&#8217;s exactly what she wanted most. She couldn&#8217;t be happier to be with us.</p>

<h3 id="dwyane">Dwyane</h3>

<p>Dwyane is in preschool primarily to help with speech. He was withdrawn and wouldn&#8217;t say much but he has blossomed this past year. We think he finally decided he was safe and therefore decided to come out of his shell. His teacher says Dwyane is a model student, a great example, and is always ready and willing to help the teacher. He puts toys up when he&#8217;s done playing with them, and he shares and gets along with the other children.</p>

<p>School is Dwyane&#8217;s favorite activity. He&#8217;s proud to be in school, and he&#8217;s doing great. Good marks and learning a lot. He likes to share with us about his day during dinner and you can see he loves it. Dwyane will graduate to kindergarten this fall upon the recommendation of his teacher. He was screened as well and did good with counting, writing his name, ABC&#8217;s, etc. He&#8217;s ready to be a big kid now and go to school with Dillan and Ashley.</p>

<p>Dwyane is too young to be involved in extracurricular activities. He did learn to ice skate and can do so with our help, almost on his own but not quite yet. He likes the same snow activities as his older siblings, and especially likes sledding. He is too afraid or timid to try some things even with our assurances and help.</p>

<p>Dwyane will be busier this summer. We signed him up for tee-ball and he&#8217;s excited to be playing. He&#8217;s a strong hitter. We plan to sign him up for swimming lessons as well. He likes the pool and puts his face underwater so we feel he&#8217;s mature enough to get something out of lessons. Dwyane started riding his bike last year with training wheels and most likely they can come off this summer.</p>

<p>Dwyane is lactose intolerant and has mild allergies. He&#8217;s the smallest of the four but he&#8217;s a good eater. He likes pizza. He&#8217;ll eat a whole one by himself if you let him. His favorite color lately has been blue. He likes trucks. He likes playing with and crashing them. He likes trains. He&#8217;s been on several real trains and likes them a lot. He&#8217;s also like planes and has been on a real one.</p>

<p>He has a loving heart and wants to please us and wants everyone to get along. He&#8217;s a little more sensitive than the other kids. He&#8217;s smart and catches on fast. He&#8217;s a bit mischievous and likes to kid us and his siblings. He likes getting tickled. Dwyane likes music, especially music with a beat. He&#8217;s a good dancer. He likes to air guitar and air drum, and he likes to sing. Dwyane will probably be interested in learning an instrument down the road.</p>

<p>Dwyane loves his siblings very much. He likes to hang with Dillan and tries to be like Dillan, but he is probably closest to Bruce. Dwyane and Bruce are almost inseparable. They fight all the time but are lost without each other. He likes building stuff with blocks, Legos, and Lincoln Logs.</p>

<p>Dwyane is unique. People like him. We like and love him. He likes and loves us too. He knows he is adopted but he doesn&#8217;t have a clue what that means. Even when Dillan and Ashley tell him he has another mom and dad he just looks at you incredulously. Makes no sense to him. We&#8217;re the only mom and dad he remembers and as far as he&#8217;s concerned we always have been and always will be.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s well liked and well adjusted. He&#8217;s smart, he&#8217;s happy, he&#8217;s a pleasure to be around. He likes his life with us and doesn&#8217;t know about, nor can imagine, any other. Dwyane is a normal and happy little boy who is thrilled to start his kindergarten adventure this fall. We feel blessed to share in his excitement.</p>

<h3 id="bruce">Bruce</h3>

<p>Bruce is not of school age and he was released from First Steps / Head Start two years ago as having age appropriate skills meaning he didn&#8217;t need those services. He attends a preschool / daycare when we are at work. Bruce is a very smart boy, rivaling Ashley, and is on par with, if not ahead of, other kids his age.</p>

<p>Bruce can ice skate with help and he has a good time. He likes sledding and snowmen like his siblings. He loves playing with Play-Doh and likes other board games. He mostly likes putting on his snow suit and making snow angels and just tromping around. He likes playing in mud and water even more than snow.</p>

<p>In the summer, he does everything the other kids do except maybe ride bikes. He has a tricycle and a Big Wheel that he loves to ride. He likes Lesa to walk him down the street to visit the animals – horses, goats, mules, and sheep. He feeds them grass and he gets a kick out of it. He also likes to swing on our swing set and go down the slide.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re signing him up for parent-assisted swimming lessons. He plays in our pool all summer and runs and jumps in, dunks, has squirt gun fights, and all the other stuff with his siblings. Bruce is fearless. He&#8217;s the toughest of all the kids. He&#8217;s also the meanest. He&#8217;s what I call a scrapper. He wants to do everything his older siblings do and he tries his best to do so. This makes him a handful sometimes. He tests all the boundaries and limits. We keep an eye on him to keep him from getting hurt.</p>

<p>An example of his fearlessness is when we went to Ft. Lauderdale. He was the only one that would paddle up and down the canals with me in a kayak. He even liked the open choppier water. The other kids were too frightened to enjoy the ride but Bruce thought it was great fun and still talks about it.</p>

<p>Bruce is curious and asks questions because he wants to know about things. He is smart and catches on fast and has a good memory. Bruce has a sense of humor and is the jokester of the four. He&#8217;s always cutting up and laughing. He loves his siblings for sure and he loves us for sure too. His very favorite thing to do is to hang with us. He follows Lesa around the house and loves to help her do things. Lesa is always letting him help her in new and different ways. He likes to help me too but mostly he likes to sit and chat and go with me whenever I go somewhere. Even at three he holds an intelligent conversation. We sit on the deck and look down our hill and over our field and just chat. He&#8217;s our buddy.</p>

<p>Bruce is a good eater. He would eat only fruit if you let him. His favorite food is oranges. He picks fruit over candy. He&#8217;s the one that likes vegetables like broccoli but things should look good or he doesn&#8217;t want to try it. His favorite color is red. He likes cars, trucks, and tractors and says he wants a big red tractor when he&#8217;s big. He likes mountain lions for some reason, and he loves watching monster trucks.</p>

<p>Bruce doesn&#8217;t know about you. He&#8217;s too young. Dillan and Ashley have told him he has another mom and dad but it doesn&#8217;t mean anything or it doesn&#8217;t register. We&#8217;re mom and dad and he&#8217;s happy with that. He&#8217;s completely comfortable and at home as all the children are.</p>

<p>Bruce is growing up fast. Last month he went to his first birthday party. He understood the gift was for his daycare friend and was excited to give it to him. The party was a bowling party and Bruce got to bowl for the first time. He loved it. He insisted that I not help with the ball or rolling. He wants to be grown and independent. Bruce is a cool kid and everyone likes him even if he is a handful. I can&#8217;t wait to sit and talk with him over a beer when he&#8217;s an adult.</p>
