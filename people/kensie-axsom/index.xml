      <description>Drove kids to school. Dwyane took a field trip to Spring Mill and had a picnic there, took a hike, visited the Grissom Space Center and played on the playground, according to Dwyane he had a great day. Mr Hudson talked to Kensie and Ashley again! Left a message on the machine but I didn&amp;#8217;t get to hear it because Lesa accidentally erased it. Lesa picked up Ashley from cheer practice, then picked up the boys from daycare.</description>
