      <description>Friday! Took kids to bus stop. Lesa and I had a date night and we both took off a little bit early from work. I picked up the kids and we headed to Bloomington. Todd and Paulette Davidson watched the kids for us so we could go out for dinner. It was awesome. We went to Red Lobster, or as Bruce called it, Red Hamsters. Had a fantastic dinner and then we went to the mall and walked around a bit, talked, joked about being the old people walking the mall for exercise.</description>
