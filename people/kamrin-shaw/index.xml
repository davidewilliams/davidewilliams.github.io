      <description>Christmas Day! Ashley got up at 4:00am, woke up Dillan at 4:30am, woke me up at 5:00am, I told her come back at 7:00am, and she did. Got up, Santa had visited, stockings were full too. Let the kids play all morning. Left for Indy and the Dellinger Christmas at noon, stopped at McDonald&amp;#8217;s on way, kids played with their cousins and had such fun. I haven&amp;#8217;t had much contact with my birth mom&amp;#8217;s side over the years but I&amp;#8217;m glad they accept the kids the way they do.</description>
