      <description>Christmas Day! Ashley got up at 4:00am, woke up Dillan at 4:30am, woke me up at 5:00am, I told her come back at 7:00am, and she did. Got up, Santa had visited, stockings were full too. Let the kids play all morning. Left for Indy and the Dellinger Christmas at noon, stopped at McDonald&amp;#8217;s on way, kids played with their cousins and had such fun. I haven&amp;#8217;t had much contact with my birth mom&amp;#8217;s side over the years but I&amp;#8217;m glad they accept the kids the way they do.</description>

      <description>Slept in, sort of. Had to get up to go to Avery and Emily&amp;#8217;s for Thanksgiving. Kids super excited to see their cousins and played with them all day. Lesa and I hung with family and everyone had a good dinner. Hate the drive to Indy now-a-days but we made good time coming and going. The kids rode bikes when we got home, it was near dark but we let them burn off the energy anyway.</description>

      <description>Friday the 13th plus a full moon. Worked a full day even though I tried to get out of there to go camping. Lesa tried to help by going into, and leaving, work early. Got pizza from Papa John&amp;#8217;s. Smattering of rain in the afternoon but quickly stopped. Jordan sent a link to the finished PAVA photos. Got the kids, packed up the truck, said goodbyes and the boys and me went to camp and the Shoot-O-Ree tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Got up early and dressed for our 2019 PAVA photo shoot at Southeastway Park in Indy. Jordan took photos again per tradition. Shot in a different location than the rock this year, took the photos near the pond. The kids did pretty well and then started getting bored of course. Afterward, we had a picnic lunch and let the kids play on the playground. We noticed 456 South westbound lanes were closed so we had to drive through Wanamaker and Greenwood to get back to Highway 37 and home.</description>
