      <description>Took kids to school. Worked half a day at Scientia, other half at SAIC. Lesa took the day off, DST blues. She went shopping for supplies, hopefully enough to get us through two weeks of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic but I doubt it. No troubles at school or daycare. Picked kids up and came home, Lesa had supper made. We ate and I took the boys to Cub Scouts. Dwyane packed care packages for the Bedford Police Department.</description>

      <description>School open, took kids. Went to work myself. Lesa worked as well. Non-eventful work and school day. Lesa picked up Ashley after her cheerleading practice. I picked up the boys. Slow evening but got an email from Jerry Hill concerning the school closings, particularly Springville Elementary. Called him and he wants me to speak at the public input session tomorrow night at the BNL PAC center. He also told Lesa a couple of weeks ago I should run for school board.</description>
