      <description>Lesa had kids fed when I got up, fixed me breakfast too. We went to church, Family Sunday but I was lead in back and also lobby security so didn&amp;#8217;t get to spend time with family. Had Dillan help again with communion and he did good. Ashley had all her Cincinnati Christian Girl Scout cookie orders and got most of them handed out and paid for. Kaleena called and asked Ashley to come down to play, Ashley ate lunch and got Springville cookie orders ready for Monday, and then went down.</description>

      <description>Williams Thanksgiving today. Nasty rainy day all day. Lesa had a lot of cooking going on so I took the kids to Starbucks to get hot chocolate and mostly to get then out of her hair. Then we went to Walmart and got a couple of items Lesa needed like dinner rolls and celery. Skipped the donuts even though it was tempting. First to show was Sarah and Kaleigh followed by Becky and kids.</description>
