      <description>Ashley&amp;#8217;s last day taking Prednisone, how her behavior improves and she feels better. Dropped the kids off at school, spent way too much time getting ready and taking care of animals. Work stressful, sucks, not sure where I stand, not sure why they keep me around. Jerry Davis texted and me and kids met him and Michelle at Springville Store so I could pay him for bush hogging new property, chatted awhile, kids said they missed Michelle.</description>

      <description>First day of 2019-2020 school year! Rode bus. Bruce 1st, Dwyane 2nd, Ashley 4th, Dillan 5th. Wow! Mrs Willis, Mrs Day, Mrs Malone, Mrs Davis. No homework, teachers/pupils getting to know each other. Little Starr&amp;#8217;s. They had good day, could tell they were tired. Rest of us worked.</description>
