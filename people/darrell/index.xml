      <description>Up until 4am doing the meditation, didn&amp;#8217;t fall asleep until an hour later, woke up when Lesa got up at 6a, then got woke up by kids at 7:30a. Gave the communion meditation, got a lot of positive feedback. Delivered communion to a home bound lady that made an impression on Ashley because Ashley prayed for her at lunch. Dillan went down to Gabe&amp;#8217;s, Lesa went to Walmart and Rural King, Ashley and Dwyane played in her room, Bruce played on Wii Console, and I actually got to nap.</description>
