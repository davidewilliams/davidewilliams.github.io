      <description>Skipped church, multiple people messaging wanting to know if we&amp;#8217;re okay &amp;#8211; we are. Slept until my Sunday alarm which hardly ever happens &amp;#8211; the kids or Lesa or the dogs almost always wake me up before. Ashley and me cooked breakfast for Lesa, Dwyane, and ourselves. Ashley, Dwyane, and myself played Yahtzee. Planned on doing something outdoors like hiking but it never happened. Kids rode bikes, Ashley and me mucked Oreo and Blackie&amp;#8217;s hutch, Lesa did some yard work so we were outdoors.</description>
