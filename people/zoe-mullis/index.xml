      <description>Lesa and I woke up to my 8:00am alarm. Lesa got up, I tried to snooze more but unable. Kids were still asleep! Dogs rushed into Ashley&amp;#8217;s room and nuzzled her and she woke up, the boys followed. Even our dogs love the kids! Got the Cub Scout boys ready for selling popcorn, had to get mad and light a fire under them to get them moving. Bruce was his usual grumpy self, complained about everything.</description>
