      <description>Dropped kids at school. Went to work, Kind of a nerve-racking day. Really nice outside. Picked up kids, no major daycare issues to speak of, Bruce did get mouthy with Jessica so we talked about that. Dillan put hands on a kid at school and got called out for it by Mr Hudson. Kids played outside until dinner. Dillan said Ashley has a thing for his friend Bo from school so we teased her about it.</description>
