      <description>Skipped church, multiple people messaging wanting to know if we&amp;#8217;re okay &amp;#8211; we are. Slept until my Sunday alarm which hardly ever happens &amp;#8211; the kids or Lesa or the dogs almost always wake me up before. Ashley and me cooked breakfast for Lesa, Dwyane, and ourselves. Ashley, Dwyane, and myself played Yahtzee. Planned on doing something outdoors like hiking but it never happened. Kids rode bikes, Ashley and me mucked Oreo and Blackie&amp;#8217;s hutch, Lesa did some yard work so we were outdoors.</description>

      <description>Church. I baptized Ashley and Dillan! Praise God! How awesome is that‽ We took Kathy Mitchell and Paul and Andrea Fries to El Ranchero for lunch, we all had a great time! Fantastic Sams for kid haircuts. Bought Lesa bedroom suite/mattress at Living Room Center. Truck overheating.</description>
