      <description>Woke up to snow on the ground. Super busy day. Took Ashley to Rural King to sell Girl Scout cookies at 10am, didn&amp;#8217;t sell a lot of cookies, would do much better at a grocery store I think. Came home and ate lunch and we all went to Dillan&amp;#8217;s basketball game, he is doing well, a little nervous and shooting the ball a bit hard and could use work dribbling but not bad for his first time playing.</description>
