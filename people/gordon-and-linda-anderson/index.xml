      <description>Up late last night, tired all day. Lesa kept letting the dogs in and out of the bedroom and I didn&amp;#8217;t even get to sleep until my alarm went off. Lesa stayed home from church, I was lockup deacon so we were the last ones out. Went home, got changed, and ate lunch. Dillan, Ashley, Bruce and myself went to the Tusseys. From there we went to Linda and Gordon Andersons&amp;#8217; house and picked up two huge turkeys.</description>
