      <description>School and work. Picked up kids from daycare. Only thing planned was Wheeler Mission presentation at Cincinnati Christian Church and I opted not to go. The kids are so tired as are we. Ashley had a total meltdown after getting sent to bed early for talking back to me. Everyone hates her and she hates her life. Zaida at school is being mean, Lesa and me don&amp;#8217;t love her and are being mean, and she wants to see her Grandpa David and Cousin Eve.</description>

      <description>Lesa and I woke up to my 8:00am alarm. Lesa got up, I tried to snooze more but unable. Kids were still asleep! Dogs rushed into Ashley&amp;#8217;s room and nuzzled her and she woke up, the boys followed. Even our dogs love the kids! Got the Cub Scout boys ready for selling popcorn, had to get mad and light a fire under them to get them moving. Bruce was his usual grumpy self, complained about everything.</description>
