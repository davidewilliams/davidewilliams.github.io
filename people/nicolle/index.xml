      <description>Rained all last night and day, sloppy muddy out. Took kids to bus for school. One of the first into work and didn&amp;#8217;t leave until the very last minute. Just barely got the kids! Probably close to breaking even on time, I&amp;#8217;ll figure it up tomorrow. Ashley brought home a paper about her hero &amp;#8211; it was me! I needed a shirt and tie for the dance this Friday, so I tried to take Dwyane and Bruce with me.</description>

      <description>Normal AM. Worked a long day again. Kids got their school photos. Bruce looks so stinking cute except for his face is all mangled from scrapes and cuts. Dwyane&amp;#8217;s tooth is crooked and in front of the others giving his this weird kind of smile. Ashley looks exactly like Nicolle, Lesa doesn&amp;#8217;t think so much. Dillan looks good and with a decent smile for once. At dinner all the kids tattled on everyone else&amp;#8217;s girlfriend/boyfriends &amp;#8211; none of them really have one &amp;#8211; just teasing each other.</description>
