      <description>President&amp;#8217;s Day, kids would normally have off but they have school to make up a snow day. Lesa worked and doesn&amp;#8217;t get the day off. I got the day off but worked anyway, and am trading it for tomorrow off. Lesa and I are going to tour the TK Jackson house in Greenfield &amp;#8211; they are closed Mondays. So, I worked all day at Scientia and was by myself all day, it was awesome.</description>

      <description>Slept until 8 or so, kids started to make us breakfast in bed but we got up and requested breakfast at the table instead. That was sweet of them. Easy morning, was going to haul trash but that never happened. Kids did a lot of chores trying to earn tablet and computer time. Ashley and me took cookie money to Amanda and got more cookies. Had an issue with scheduling cookie booths but got that settled as well.</description>
