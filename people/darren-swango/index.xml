      <description>I took kids to the bus stop and came back home. Lesa and I both went to talk to Dwyane&amp;#8217;s Speech Therapist Darren Swango at Springville Elementary. Got to hear the kids announcements. Dwyane is doing really good, intermittent trouble with sh sounds. Afterward we talked about Dillan&amp;#8217;s speech, he can pronounce sounds okay but tends to go to fast, run words together, and kind of mumbles his words making him difficult to understand &amp;#8211; don&amp;#8217;t we know it!</description>
