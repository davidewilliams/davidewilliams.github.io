      <description>Stayed home all morning. I was listening to Flatt &amp;amp; Scruggs Live at Neely Auditorium on Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN from May 2, 1963 and that kind of got the kids fired up. It turned into YouTube and hip-hop and others, and that of course turned into dancing and videos. The pinewood derby was supposed to be today but was canceled so we did something different. Played Words with Friends game (it&amp;#8217;s like Scrabble) with Ashley and only beat her by 6 points.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school, Dillan had his poster. Worked at SAIC all day. Bruce ate lunch in the office, Mr Hudson wasn&amp;#8217;t there, missed recess too. Stopped by PO Box on a whim and had two letters from Daniel, didn&amp;#8217;t get the usual notification I had mail. Picked up kids from daycare, nothing unusual there, Ashley upset she didn&amp;#8217;t get rewarded for cleaning up. Kind of cold outside so kids stayed in.</description>

      <description>Bus stop, school, and daycare for the kids. Work and more work for the adults. Waited until last minute before leaving to get the kids. Lesa had supper ready per usual when we got home. Girl Scout meeting was canceled. I took Dillan to his first Courts for Christ basketball practice. Ashley went with, Lesa encouraged it. Lesa stayed home with boys doing I know not what. Dillan did okay for not having really played before.</description>
