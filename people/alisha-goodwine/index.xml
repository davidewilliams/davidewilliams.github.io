      <description>Got colder so Ashley and me stuffed more hay in the rabbit hutch to help keep them warm. Took kids to school. Slow day at work, $5 sushi day so got some per usual. Picked kids up. Ashley had Girl Scouts so I dropped her off at 6pm. Went back at 7pm for awards and talked to Alisha a lot about the school closings &amp;#8211; or should say she talked to me a lot.</description>

      <description>Barely made the bus, Kim waited for the kids to get on board. Took an alternate, scenic route to work, highway under construction and down to one lane. Spent most of day doing research. Lesa having her own problems at work. Both of us pretty zoned out by the time we get home. Mrs. Davis texted us, Dillan punched William in the eye and got in trouble for it. I was none to happy!</description>
