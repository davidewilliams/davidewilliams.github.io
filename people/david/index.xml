      <description>School and work. Picked up kids from daycare. Only thing planned was Wheeler Mission presentation at Cincinnati Christian Church and I opted not to go. The kids are so tired as are we. Ashley had a total meltdown after getting sent to bed early for talking back to me. Everyone hates her and she hates her life. Zaida at school is being mean, Lesa and me don&amp;#8217;t love her and are being mean, and she wants to see her Grandpa David and Cousin Eve.</description>
