      <description>Friday, made sure Dillan and Ashley had their belongings for SuperStart. Gave them money for meals and souvenirs, drove all the kids to school and went in with them to add Ken to the sign out list. Got a couple dozen donuts for the shop and went to work. Ken picked the kids up early from school and they headed to New Albany/Louisville with the rest of the middle school youth group.</description>
