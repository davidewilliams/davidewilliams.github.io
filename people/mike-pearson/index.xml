      <description>Friday! School, daycare, work. Left early, picked up kids, got a couple hours hunting in. Bruce rode the bus home with Corbin, Grady rides the same bus, because Bruce is spending the night at Corbin&amp;#8217;s. He&amp;#8217;s been excited all week and apparently he&amp;#8217;s a big kid now &amp;#8211; at least he&amp;#8217;s been acting like it. Emma was supposed to spend the night, came over awhile and did crafts with Ashley, they made a huge mess of the glitter.</description>

      <description>Took kids to bus stop, had to go back home so Ashley could take her pill and to write Dillan an excuse to get into class. Lesa liked her flowers. Long work day, crashed a video encoder at end of the day, almost late picking up boys. Ashley had cheerleader practice, Lesa picked her up. Met the girls up on our new property along with Mike Pearson. We discussed land layout among other things.</description>
