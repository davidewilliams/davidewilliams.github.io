      <description>Lesa and I both worked full days. The kids went to school, they kids had their Christmas parties and gift exchanges and the excitement was high all day, by all accounts they had a great time. Mrs Malone and Mrs Willis blew up our phones with text messages and photos. More sledding, boys also played in the woods, none of them had gloves on! Their hands were red and will probably be chapped.</description>
