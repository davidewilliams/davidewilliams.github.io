      <description>Sort of slept in, here the pitter-patter of feet, Lesa already up, figured she&amp;#8217;d be frustrated already so I got up. Lesa made me coffee, Ashley and Bruce snuggled with me. Lazy morning for me. After lunch, I hauled trash with Ashley and Bruce, Lesa and Dillan helped load. From trash we went to Lowe&amp;#8217;s and got a new garbage disposal and some cabinet rails rear mounts. Then I bought them Frosties.</description>
