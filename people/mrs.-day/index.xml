      <description>Skipped church, multiple people messaging wanting to know if we&amp;#8217;re okay &amp;#8211; we are. Slept until my Sunday alarm which hardly ever happens &amp;#8211; the kids or Lesa or the dogs almost always wake me up before. Ashley and me cooked breakfast for Lesa, Dwyane, and ourselves. Ashley, Dwyane, and myself played Yahtzee. Planned on doing something outdoors like hiking but it never happened. Kids rode bikes, Ashley and me mucked Oreo and Blackie&amp;#8217;s hutch, Lesa did some yard work so we were outdoors.</description>

      <description>Work and school, had a frustrating day, glad it&amp;#8217;s over. Since we were going to Walmart, I thought it might save time if I just picked Lesa up, then the kids, then get a bite to eat, then Walmart. Asian Pearl, everyone got stuff they liked, it was a hit with the kids. Went to Walmart after, spent $355 dollars on a coat, new jammies for all the kids, and gift cards for Christmas.</description>

      <description>First day of 2019-2020 school year! Rode bus. Bruce 1st, Dwyane 2nd, Ashley 4th, Dillan 5th. Wow! Mrs Willis, Mrs Day, Mrs Malone, Mrs Davis. No homework, teachers/pupils getting to know each other. Little Starr&amp;#8217;s. They had good day, could tell they were tired. Rest of us worked.</description>
