      <description>Skipped church, multiple people messaging wanting to know if we&amp;#8217;re okay &amp;#8211; we are. Slept until my Sunday alarm which hardly ever happens &amp;#8211; the kids or Lesa or the dogs almost always wake me up before. Ashley and me cooked breakfast for Lesa, Dwyane, and ourselves. Ashley, Dwyane, and myself played Yahtzee. Planned on doing something outdoors like hiking but it never happened. Kids rode bikes, Ashley and me mucked Oreo and Blackie&amp;#8217;s hutch, Lesa did some yard work so we were outdoors.</description>

      <description>Everyone slept in a bit longer than usual &amp;#8211; usual is 6-7, today 7-8. Lazy morning, turned on radio, then got song requests, then the dancing. Lesa and Ashley went to get their hair cut, everyone booked up, even Walmart. Went to Taco Bell for lunch. Boys watched TV and I took a nice hot shower. Haircuts a bust so girls came home. Boys and myself had lunch. We all went to Walmart to get shoes and soup, weird combination.</description>

      <description>Dropped kids at school, Bruce took his big helicopter for Show-and-Tell. Work. Took off late and went to the bank to deposit Girl Scout cookie checks, then Dollar General for Mt. Dews and antifreeze, losing 1&amp;frasl;2 a gallon a day, don&amp;#8217;t see a leak so it must be going out the tailpipe. Picked up kids from daycare. Lesa grocery shopped after work and we helped her carry in. Then everyone went into cleaning mode while Lesa got supper together &amp;#8211; we had pizza &amp;#8211; it is Friday night after all.</description>
