      <description>Easy morning, got woke by kids, but not too early. Kids played with toys but Lesa had to put them outside, they were just too rowdy. She packed some sandwiches and at noon we headed to Sarah and Kaleigh&amp;#8217;s for the Williams Christmas. Two hours later we arrived, right on time. Becky and Maelee and boys already there, my parents and brother came shortly after. Kids had a great time, we had a good time too.</description>

      <description>Williams Thanksgiving today. Nasty rainy day all day. Lesa had a lot of cooking going on so I took the kids to Starbucks to get hot chocolate and mostly to get then out of her hair. Then we went to Walmart and got a couple of items Lesa needed like dinner rolls and celery. Skipped the donuts even though it was tempting. First to show was Sarah and Kaleigh followed by Becky and kids.</description>
