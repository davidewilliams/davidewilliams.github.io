      <description>Bus stop, school, and daycare for the kids. Work and more work for the adults. Waited until last minute before leaving to get the kids. Lesa had supper ready per usual when we got home. Girl Scout meeting was canceled. I took Dillan to his first Courts for Christ basketball practice. Ashley went with, Lesa encouraged it. Lesa stayed home with boys doing I know not what. Dillan did okay for not having really played before.</description>
