      <description>Skipped church, multiple people messaging wanting to know if we&amp;#8217;re okay &amp;#8211; we are. Slept until my Sunday alarm which hardly ever happens &amp;#8211; the kids or Lesa or the dogs almost always wake me up before. Ashley and me cooked breakfast for Lesa, Dwyane, and ourselves. Ashley, Dwyane, and myself played Yahtzee. Planned on doing something outdoors like hiking but it never happened. Kids rode bikes, Ashley and me mucked Oreo and Blackie&amp;#8217;s hutch, Lesa did some yard work so we were outdoors.</description>

      <description>Dropped kids at school, Bruce took his big helicopter for Show-and-Tell. Work. Took off late and went to the bank to deposit Girl Scout cookie checks, then Dollar General for Mt. Dews and antifreeze, losing 1&amp;frasl;2 a gallon a day, don&amp;#8217;t see a leak so it must be going out the tailpipe. Picked up kids from daycare. Lesa grocery shopped after work and we helped her carry in. Then everyone went into cleaning mode while Lesa got supper together &amp;#8211; we had pizza &amp;#8211; it is Friday night after all.</description>
