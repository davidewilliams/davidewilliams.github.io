      <description>Rained pretty heavy all night and most of the day. Got up at 8a, took Dillan to guitar lesson and picked up Ashley. During lesson, Cassie, Emma, Woodrow, Ashley and myself went to Emma Miracle&amp;#8217;s to see the baby goats. Came home and Ashley very tired but won&amp;#8217;t nap. Ate lunch. Went to Rural King, got some stuff for the rabbits and chickens. Went to Walmart and got Ashley a pair of dress shoes and a pair of dress boots, got Dillan a new pair of mud boots, and Dwyane a pair of dress shoes as well.</description>
