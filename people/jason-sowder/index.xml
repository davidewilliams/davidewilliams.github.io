      <description>Woke up exhausted, didn&amp;#8217;t want to get up, finally did. Stayed exhausted throughout the day, wound up working over even so. Jason texted and wanted to come to our house to cut pinewood derby cars, got home and he was already waiting in our drive, we cut the cars and the boys painted already, I polished the axles so they might go faster. Lesa went and got milk after dinner. Kids on devices or taking showers.</description>

      <description>Took kids to school. Spent the entire day at SAIC. Lesa back at work, sent me email IU is closing classes after Spring Break and almost everyone will be working remotely. Pulled a nine hour day and then picked up kids from daycare, I&amp;#8217;m utterly exhausted. Slept much of the evening on the couch. Kids watched television and played and made much noise which irritated me. Jason Sowder was going to cut pinewood derby cars for me and the boys but cancelled earlier in the afternoon, hopefully tomorrow.</description>
