      <description>Church, I taught in Junior Church as well. Kids glad I was there and the boys hung out with me. They love us so much it&amp;#8217;s hard to fathom sometimes. After church, Shane Schroyer came out and checked our furnace, it was acting kind of odd a few weeks ago but seems to be okay. Bruce and then Dillan hung out with us to watch. After Shane left we had lunch.</description>
