      <description>Church, Deacon in Back and Lobby Security. Afterward, we hooked up trailer and loaded bikes, got gas, and went to Paul and Andrea&amp;#8217;s for lunch with the Johnsons. Beautiful day for cookout. Kids rode bikes and had an awesome time and didn&amp;#8217;t want to leave. Got home and kids still rambunctious and played outside. Kaleena came over and ate with us. I got into a fight with Lesa and left for a couple of hours, had to decide whether I wanted to come back or not, came back for the kids&amp;#8217; sake.</description>

      <description>Church, paid for Dillan and Ashley to go to SuperStart. Lesa got mad at Dillan and me for horsing in the pews during the sermon. Ross and Bobbi Johnson&amp;#8217;s last day, most likely won&amp;#8217;t see them again. They gave kids some Matchbox toy cars. We took them and the Fries out to lunch at El Ranchero Mexican Restaurant in Bloomington, we all had a nice time &amp;#8211; even the kids. Always hard to lose good friends and decent people.</description>

      <description>Scheduling hell, Lesa had girls day out with Andrea and Bobbie. I was supposed to go fishing and rent boat with Paul and Ross and kids. Ashley had a GS Horseback Riding event. Lesa canceled fishing for me after scheduling fishing for me. Anyway, Ashley woke up with allergic reaction on her face, called doctor, suggested Benadryl, didn&amp;#8217;t help like we knew it wouldn&amp;#8217;t. Got a plate for the 4Runner, chicken and rabbit feed, and took the kids to lunch at Steak &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217; Shake.</description>
