      <description>Lesa woke up to Dillan. I woke up to Lesa, the rest of the kids woke up to me. Ashley&amp;#8217;s rash is back &amp;#8211; on her back this time. Spent the day in the Smokey Mountain National Park. Started off at the Townsend entrance sign, then some little overlook with a small waterfall in the background. The Sinks were next, it&amp;#8217;s kind of a shame the kids couldn&amp;#8217;t explore on the rocks and stuff like Lesa and I did the last time we were here but it was also kind of a relief.</description>

      <description>Finished packing and loading the truck. Headed for the Smokies. Sonja is pet sitting. Took us 7 hours to get here. Had a decent trip. Kids are driving us crazy and I swore I was going to whip all of them &amp;#8211; multiple times &amp;#8211; but never did. Got to our place in Townsend, I thought it was a cabin but it was a house instead, really nice place and I have no complaints.</description>
