      <description>Serving deacon, Dillan and Ashley got Baptism Certificates and Bible Study books from Tonya Johnson and church, visited Nancy Huffman and Gladys Gilland. Ate lunch at Burger King. Dwyane needed new tires and tubes plus an entire wheel since the bearings are blown out so Lesa and I decided we&amp;#8217;d make it a Dad and Dwyane outing to Walmart. Inner tubes and wheel alone cost nearly as much as a new bike, plus they didn&amp;#8217;t have a wheel, so Dwyane got to pick out a new bike!</description>
