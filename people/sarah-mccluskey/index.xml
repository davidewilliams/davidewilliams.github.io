      <description>Slept in and a lazy morning, kids did some chores and workbooks to get tablet, computer, or Wii time. A lot of looking over the other&amp;#8217;s shoulder to see what the other was up to. After lunch we went to the library and saw the McCluskey&amp;#8217;s. I threw a fit over the books Dillan tends to get before we left and he picked two that were more age appropriate but I doubt he&amp;#8217;ll read them, will probably just backfire on me.</description>

      <description>Sort of slept in, here the pitter-patter of feet, Lesa already up, figured she&amp;#8217;d be frustrated already so I got up. Lesa made me coffee, Ashley and Bruce snuggled with me. Lazy morning for me. After lunch, I hauled trash with Ashley and Bruce, Lesa and Dillan helped load. From trash we went to Lowe&amp;#8217;s and got a new garbage disposal and some cabinet rails rear mounts. Then I bought them Frosties.</description>
