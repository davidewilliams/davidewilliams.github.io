      <description>Kids woke us up, I sent them to their rooms and told them to be quiet. Went back to bed and to sleep. Lesa got up and kept things quiet. I slept until 10am! Longest in almost 6 years unless sick. It was awesome. Lesa made me coffee which was nice. I played Battleship with Ashley, then Dwyane. Took Dwyane to Mrs Dillman&amp;#8217;s house, her grandson Jay invited Dwyane to spend the night and go to Urban Air with them, it&amp;#8217;s his first sleepover, I think he&amp;#8217;s ready and will be okay.</description>
